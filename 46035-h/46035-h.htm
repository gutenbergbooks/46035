<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pn p2">The following pages owe a considerable debt to
what others who have been over the same ground
have written. Mr. T. A. Cook's<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "Old Provence"
(London: Rivington's, 2 vols.) is a most
valuable record of the history of the country
as it attaches to the innumerable places of interest
to be visited, and his taste and knowledge
when brought to bear upon its architectural remains
have greatly enhanced my own appreciation
of those rich treasures. I know of no book,
either in French or English, from which a visitor
to Provence could get so much to supplement
his own observation, and I have made constant
use of it. To Mr. Thomas Okey's<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "Avignon"
in Dent's "Mediæval Towns" series, I also owe
a great debt of gratitude. The Rev. Sabine
Baring-Gould's "In Troubadour Land" (London:
W. H. Allen), though slighter than those
two works, contains much interesting information.
Mistral's "Mes Origines" (Paris: Libraire
Plon), translated from the Provençal, is of course
invaluable for its pictures of Provençal life, and
from that book and from M. Paul Mariéton's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
"La Terre Provençale" (Paris: Ollendorf) one
can get the best information about the movement
of the Félibrige, which has done so much
to revivify the old life of Provence. A good
deal of desultory information is afforded by M.
Louis de Laincel's "La Provence" (Paris:
Oudin), and some of the stories that linger on
Provençal soil are well told in M. Charles-Roux's
"Légendes de Provence" (Paris: Bloud). These
books, and the French translation of Mistral's
"Mirèio," which is a mine of Provençal lore,
besides being a noble poem, have been my chief
"authorities," but they have been very usefully
supplemented by the various pamphlets to be
picked up locally. Some of these have been
excellent, and I have made mention of their
authors in the following pages.</p>

<p>The photographs are of my own taking, except
those very kindly given to me by Mr. Hope
Macey, whom I was fortunate enough to come
across in Avignon in the course of an expedition
that coincided with mine at many points. The
one of Mistral's birthplace I bought at Arles,
and those of the picture and tapestry at Aix in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This account of my spring journey has been
finished under the shadow of the great war,
which might have caused me to look upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
<i>jours de conscription</i> with which I fell in on
the early days of the walk in a light much sadder,
if I could have foreseen it. I left Provence in
a train full of young soldiers going to their homes
in various distant parts of France for their Easter
furlough. Of those who crowded the carriage
in which I travelled from Arles to Lyons the faces
come before me as clearly as if I saw them in
the flesh, and I can hear their songs and jokes
and laughter. They seemed to have been drawn
from all classes, but to mix in the readiest frankest
comradeship. Whenever I read now of the
French in action I think of those light-hearted
boys in their holiday mood, and wonder what they
are doing, and how many of them are still alive.
One has somewhat changed one's view of the
toll that France has taken of her manhood since
those days that now seem so far off.</p>

<p class="pn p2">The world has changed since this book was
written, but I hope that the record of an expedition
made in the happy days before the war
may still be read with pleasure, now that the great
shadow is in part removed. I have been over the
manuscript again and made a few alterations
here and there, but have altered nothing that shows
it to have been written five years ago.</p>

<p class="pn center p4 xlarge">A SPRING WALK IN PROVENCE</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Hills and Olives</i></p>


<p class="pn p2">I was to walk through the country from the
Italian border, but it rained so heavily on the
first day that I went to Mentone and took the
mountain tramway to Sospel, where in any case
I had intended to spend the night.</p>

<p>Two years ago, before this tram-line was quite
finished, I motored up to Sospel to play golf.
It was a pleasant experience, though not without
its thrills, for the road zigzags and corkscrews
up mountain sides and across deep gorges in a
way to make one thankful for strong brakes
and a reliable driver, especially on the return
journey. The hillsides are cultivated everywhere.
The precipitous slopes have been terraced with
infinite labour, and orange and lemon groves
surrounding pretty little lodges and cottages,
only give way as one mounts higher to the grey-green
of olive plantations.</p>

<p>When you have climbed up 2,300 feet, the
road, as if tired of twisting and turning, boldly
attacks the mountain side, runs through a tunnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
pierced in the solid rock and comes out on the
other side of the peak. Then it takes a turn so
sharp that not long ago a car coming too fast
through the tunnel went over the precipitous edge
and all its occupants were killed.</p>

<p>The crowning danger safely surmounted, you
drop down into a green mountain valley, surrounded
by what Smollett, who passed through
Sospel on his way from Nice to Italy a hundred
and fifty years ago, described as "prodigious
high and barren mountains." The valley is all
verdant pasture, watered by a broad, shallow,
tree-shaded river, which, to quote the same authority,
"forms a delightful contrast with the hideous
rocks surrounding it." All mountains were "hideous"
and "horrid" in the eyes of our ancestors.
We, as we play along the grassy meadows, and
cross here and there the clear river rippling over
its pebbles, have come to think that the towering
rock-ramparts, upon which the sun and the clouds
play with infinite gradations of light and colour,
have as much to do with the beauty of the scene
as the verdant valley itself, or the little old huddled
Italian-looking town which hugs both banks
of the river.</p>

<p>It was that little old town, which the golfer
coming up from Mentone only skirts on his way
to the links, that had remained in my memory,
even more than the unusual charm of the links<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and the excellence of the greens. It stands curiously
aside from the wave of modernity that has
washed up to it from the wealthy delocalized coast.
Turn to the right when you reach the corner, and
you are still in the atmosphere of the Côte d'Azur,
although you are fifteen miles inland from Mentone;
turn to the left and you are in southern
provincial France, in a street of little shops and
little <i>cafés</i> and <i>buvettes</i>, and pick your way
amongst a crowd of peasants and townspeople,
buying and selling, talking of their crops and
their commerce, and as little concerned with what
is going on half a mile away as if they had never
seen a mashie or a putter, and none of them had
ever shouldered a bag of clubs for a curiously-garbed
curiously-spoken foreigner.</p>

<p>Probably it is only the caddies or the ex-caddies
who ever mention golf in the town of
Sospel. It stands so aloof that even its prices
have not yet been affected by the lavish ways
of the holiday coast, with which it has formed
this late new connection.</p>

<p>So I turned to the left. I wanted to have
done for a time with everything English, and
more particularly with the sort of hotel that has
an English-speaking waiter, or indeed a waiter
at all. Sospel was to provide me with my first
genuine experience of a French inn, as used by
the people of the country and not by the tourist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Sospel rose adequately to the occasion, as I
had thought it would. I found an hotel facing
the market stalls and the river beyond them. I
went up a flight of stone stairs and into a kitchen,
which was also the bureau of the <i>patronne</i>. Yes,
I could have a room for the night, and the charge
would be two francs. I went up to see the room.
It had a tiled floor, which was very clean, a large
four-poster bed hung round with muslin curtains,
and a few old cumbrous pieces of furniture besides&mdash;just
the sort of room I wanted.</p>

<p>I had a good dinner, which I ate in company
with four <i>commis voyageurs</i> and an engineer, all
of whom were cordially interested in my coming
expedition, and none of whom had a word of
English or seemed to have any idea in their minds
of connecting Sospel with golf. I felt that I had
fallen plumb into it by taking that left-hand turn,
and it needed an effort to call to mind the great
new hotel at the other end of the links two miles
away, where no diner had tucked his napkin inside
his collar, or would soak his dessert biscuits
in his wine; where the waiter brought a clean knife
and fork for every course, and the proprietor
would have requested me to leave if I had sat
down in the clothes in which I intended to walk
on the morrow. I felt happy, as I went to bed
at nine o'clock, after a look at the rapid-flowing
river on which the moon was now shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
through the parting clouds. The fun had
begun.</p>

<p>I felt happier still at six o'clock the next morning,
when I took the road with my pack on my
back. The clouds had blown away from the
mountain tops, though wisps of them hung about
the lower slopes, and the cup of the valley still
held a light mist. It was going to be a lovely
day, and perhaps hotter than would be altogether
comfortable for a walker habited and burdened
as I was. For it was still early in March, and I
had come down from Alpine snows. Moreover,
the replenishments of clothing that I had sent on
ahead were at least a week away, and I carried
"changes" to a rather nervous extent; also some
reading matter, which is a mistake, for books
weigh heavy, however light their contents, and if
your day on the road is not filled with walking,
eating and sleeping, and whatever recreation in
the way of talk may come to you, you are not
throwing yourself enough into the spirit of your
adventure.</p>

<p>The road wound and turned and twisted, always
going uphill, but never very steeply. I was
on the old high road from the north, where it enters
on its last stage of about five and twenty
miles to Nice. I thought I must have come
near to its highest point when I had climbed up
on a level with the heavy fort that frowned on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
me from a hill near by, and sat down to take
my last look at the green valley now lying far
beneath me.</p>

<p>It showed as a level carpet of vivid green,
broken by the grey mass and outlying buildings
of the town, with the river threading it lengthwise.
The hills rose up sheer on every side.
Their lower slopes were so regularly terraced
that at this distance they had the effect of horizontal
"shadings" in a pencil drawing. Above
that they were grey, and dark green, and red
as with heather, and the summits of some of them
still held snow. White roads jagged them here
and there, but the flat valley floor had the effect
of being completely cupped and confined by the
rugged heights, as indeed it is, except just where
the river, having filled up the bottom of the cup
with a rich layer of alluvium, must have broken
through at some time, and left the fertile plain
all ready and waiting for cultivation. It was like
looking down on a miniature Promised Land,
so marked was the contrast between the fresh
green of the valley and the sombre tones of its
encircling hills.</p>

<p>This southern country flushes to tender spring
green only here and there. The cultivated hillsides
keep their darker colours, though they may
be most sweetly lit with the pink of almonds.
March would be a glorious month in Provence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
if it were only for the almond blossom. Mixed
with the soft grey of the olives it makes delicious
pictures, and it is to be found everywhere. And
the wild rosemary is in flower&mdash;great bushes of
it, lighting up the rocky hillsides with their delicate
blue. They were all around me as I sat
on this height, and there were brooms getting
ready to flower, and wild lavender, and thyme.
The air held an aromatic fragrance, and as I
walked on between the pines and the deciduous
trees, not yet in leaf, the birds were singing and
the water rushing down its channels from the
snowy heights very musically. There were primroses
and violets by the roadside, as if it had
been spring in England, and juicy little grape
hyacinths to remind one that it was not. There
was something to look at and enjoy at every step.</p>

<p>I was nowhere near the top of the pass, as
I had thought, but reached it at last at the Col
de Braus, where I found a rude little inn, and
entered it not without reluctance in search of
refreshment.</p>

<p>I found myself in a vaulted stone kitchen, its
floor below the level of the ground outside. An
elderly woman sat by the hearth, winding wool,
with a child playing at her knee; a younger woman
brought me wine and bread and cheese. The
place was very dirty, but the wine was good and
the viands eatable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The older woman was a picture of grief as she
sat under the great stone chimney and told me
how hard life was in that exposed spot, especially
in the winter, when they were sometimes
flooded out of the lower rooms. And now they
had taken away her only son, for his military
service, and what she should do without him she
could not think. It was a hard tax on poor
mothers. In three years, when he had done
with the army, who knew? She might be dead.</p>

<p>"But you have a husband, madame, isn't it
so? Otherwise they could not take him."</p>

<p>Yes; she had a husband. She nodded her head
slowly with infinite meaning, and as if to interpret
it there entered the room an extremely unattractive
person, dirtier even than his dirty surroundings,
who addressed her, or the younger
woman, or perhaps me, in a flood of intemperate
speech, of which I could not make out a single
word. Nobody answered him, and he slouched
out of the room again.</p>

<p>"Is that your husband, madame?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head slowly up and down,
without speaking. I could see for myself.</p>

<p>We talked about the little child, and her face
lighted up. Presently the husband came in again,
and expressed himself in his unrecognizable tongue
with as much freedom and fervour as before.
Again nobody took any notice of him, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
he went out. I don't know whether he was drunk
or not, but am inclined now to think that he
only wanted to be. I was sure that he was annoyed
with me, for some reason, by the way he
glared at me, and as I was a customer and
prepared to pay for my entertainment it must
either have been because I did not offer him any
or because I was interfering with the hour of
his own repast. I think it is likely that his bark,
which was strident enough, was worse than his
bite, that he was merely a ne'er-do-well with an
unusual gift of self-expression, which had ceased
to interest those about him. His wife took no
steps to carry out whatever may have been his
wishes at this particular juncture of circumstances,
and her attitude of frozen grief, effective
at the time, thawed enough to enable her to
make a mild overcharge when I came to settle up.
She gave me permission to take a photograph
of the room and its occupants if I wished to do
so, but I said that the light was not good enough,
and came away.</p>

<p>Now I changed my view for a different set
of hills, and began to descend on roads that zigzagged
more than ever. There was a good deal
of quarrying going on. Great blocks of stone
were lying by the roadside ready to be built up
into the parapet, and presently I came upon a
group of Italian workmen busy with their picks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and crowbars. I don't know why, after all these
years, the enormous work of protecting this old
road should be taken in hand, but certainly there
are places in it at which a fall over the edge can
hardly be thought of without a shudder, and with
the surface in the muddy state in which I found
it a motor-car might easily skid with danger.
At one place, if you stand where it rounds a point
and look down to where it takes another slope,
it looks just like a temperature chart, where the
thermometer has taken a series of rises and drops
and at last runs off steadily downwards.</p>

<p>This long downward slope led me at last to
welcome shade, and I found a little lawn under
olive boughs, below the road and above a river
gorge which was an ideal place for a siesta. If
food and drink are so good when one is on the
long steady tramp, sleep is no less so. There
are those who scorn it except at night between
sheets, but when one has made an early start,
and has covered many miles by the time the sun
has reached its greatest power, it is pleasant
enough to sleep for an hour under the shade of
a tree, and to wake up refreshed for what remains
to be done of the day's journey.</p>

<p>The sound of the river beneath me, and the
birds singing all around, lulled me to sleep. But
for this there was no sound, except a very rare
noise of wheels, and once a motor-car, on the
road above, to arouse me for a moment and to
make the sinking back into sleep more blissful.
The first time, on an expedition of this sort, that
you take your pack for a pillow, mother earth
for your bed and green leaves for your canopy,
there is something that falls away from you of
the troubles and irritations of the world. You
are as near to nature as you are ever likely to
be in this sophisticated age, and nature will
smooth things out for you if you trust yourself
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I dropped down to L'Escaréne, a picturesque
old town with an ancient bridge straddling across
the quick-flowing river. But before I reached it
I was met by a man with a drum and several
intoxicated youths carrying a flag, who cried
"Vive la République" and "Vive l'armée," with
the most patriotic fervour. I had begun my walk
just at the time when the conscripts were being
called up from their homes all over France, and
lived in the thick of the concomitant disturbances
during the next few days. These rather pathetic
little processions of service-old boys, usually accompanied
by middle-aged men more drunk than
they were, trailing out of a town and back again,
became a commonplace. They shouted at me frequently,
but never rudely.</p>

<p>I sat under a naked vine-trellis on a raised terrace
outside an inn and drank wine. A talkative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
damsel, with needlework to occupy her
hands, but nothing to keep her fine eyes from
noting everything that happened in the <i>place</i>,
for the observation of which this was a vantage-ground,
kept me company. She explained to
me, with much shrugging of shapely shoulders,
some of the differences between the <i>patois</i> used
in this part of the country and the true French,
but she disclaimed knowledge of Provençal. I
was in Provence, but not yet among the true
Provençals&mdash;unless I mistook her altogether, which
is quite possible.</p>

<p>She gave me excited and exhaustive instructions
how to reach the hill town of Berre, where I had
thought to spend the night. I had had a description
of it from the engineer in whose company I
had dined the evening before, and when I came
within sight of it, perched on its rock summit,
an hour or two later, its high walls and dominating
church tower lit by the westering sun, it
gave me a little thrill&mdash;it was so beautiful, and so
just right.</p>

<p>It was just right to look at from a distance,
or for a walk through its narrow twisting
alleys, part staircase, part passage, part drain.
There is nothing more picturesque than these
little rock-perched towns and villages that lie
behind the Italian and French Rivieras. They
are as untouched as anything in the way of congregated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
buildings can be in these days, and carry
your imagination right back into the past. And
I had thought that a night spent in some old
inn in one of them would strengthen that touch
of romance for me.</p>

<p>But in Berre there was no inn such as I had
pictured, where one would sleep in such a room
as I had slept in the night before and awake to
a glorious view as from some commanding tower.
There were two <i>cafés</i>, and I penetrated one of
them in search of dinner and a bed. Militarism
was being celebrated with much consumption of
fluid, and much singing and shouting, and the
place was very dirty, and had that air of hard
discomfort and newness which is the peculiar
property of French <i>buvettes</i> of the poorer sort.
I was not sorry to be told that it was impossible
for me to have a bed there. I think I could have
got one by pressing for it, but I did not press.
The romance of Berre was oozing out fast, and
I still had in me the four miles or so that would
take me to Contes, in the valley below.</p>

<p>The revellers here were all men of middle age,
or at any rate long past the age at which the
new three years' service could affect them personally,
but their enthusiasm for it was very
great. One of them, who had detached himself
from the rest while I had been making my enquiries
and was reeling down the road waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a branch of mimosa and singing loudly, showed
me the way to Contes; for I already knew better
than to follow the road, which always approaches
these high-perched villages in an over-deliberate
fashion for pedestrians. He was very amiable
about it, and I rather feared that he would offer
to go with me. But he only came a little way,
to where he could point me out a mule-track,
and during our walk together I understood him
to be persuading me, and possibly himself, that
he was on the eve of gaining much military glory.
But he was bald and pot-bellied, and I think
that he was only touched by that noble and unselfish
enthusiasm which takes patriotic men when
there is question of other people doing their
duty.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling, and I went down stony
paths between olive gardens, which are very
peaceful and mysterious in twilight. I met some
of the inhabitants of Berre mounting slowly to
their little town after their day's work. Most
of the women carried cut olive boughs on their
heads, and some of the men drove asses laden
with them. It was the time of pruning, and olive
leaves are very acceptable to most animals as
food. By and bye I had the track to myself,
and sometimes lost it, but I did not much mind.
I could see the lights of Contes below me, and
whenever I found myself on a path that seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to lead aside from them I took a straight line
over the terraces till I found a more suitable one.
I was rather tired, but rest and refreshment were
not far off, and it was soothing to the spirit
to walk in this odorous dusk, and in such quietness.</p>

<p>It was quite dark by the time I came to Contes,
and I was quite ready for my dinner. But I
did not reach it for some time yet. When I had
gone down long, steep, paved paths between
walls to what seemed to be the heart of the
town I had to go down much farther still until
I thought I should never come to the end of
things. But at last, there was the bottom of
the hill, and an hotel, no less, with a garden
in front of it.</p>

<p>I sat down in the <i>café</i>, since, although a room
was promised me, there was no suggestion of
taking me to it, and at the moment I had no
wish to mount stairs even for the sake of a wash.
There are certain habits of civilization that are
very easily dropped. One comes to the end
of a day's march, and one's first desire is for
rest, one's second for food and drink; and in
these little inns this sequence of desire seems
to be well understood. It seemed quite natural
to exchange my heavy dusty boots for a pair of
slippers out of my pack, sitting by the table, to
pass at once to the consumption of wine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as soon as might be to the consumption of food,
without any further preparation.</p>

<p>The wine was very good, with a slight tang
that was almost a sparkle in it, and as I sat
blissfully at rest with it the room was invaded
first by a man with a drum, then by a man with
a cornet, then by several more men with very
loud voices. I was immediately whisked away
by the youth who had received me, and who
seemed to be in sole charge of the place, into
another little room across a passage, where he
presently served me with dinner, consisting of
soup, an omelette, beef, potatoes and carrots,
cheese, oranges, and biscuits, and another litre
of the good wine. Soon after that he showed
me a clean little room, in which I slept deeply,
hardly disturbed by the voices of the <i>jour de
fête</i> beneath me, and was only once thoroughly
awakened, at about one o'clock, by a great bustle
of arrival in a room adjoining mine.</p>

<p>The busy young man was still as active as
possible at that hour, but he was quite ready to
give me my coffee at six o'clock the next morning,
at a little table in the garden. He had
also thoroughly cleaned my boots, but before I
left I heard him called a marauder for something
or other he had omitted to do for the two gentlemen
who had arrived in the night.</p>

<p>For the whole of this entertainment I paid five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
francs and a half, and the helpful and willing
young man explained that the charge was rather
high because I had drunk two litres of wine.</p>

<p>And so I came happily to my second day,
in the bright spring sunshine.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Flowers and Scents</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">If you look at a map of this coast, before it
begins to run south from Cagnes and Villeneuve,
you will see that the hills stretch down to the
sea like the fingers of a hand spread out, and the
main roads run down between them. I should
have preferred to keep away from the coast and
cross the remaining ranges by tracks and footpaths,
but I wanted to see a relative who lives
at Nice. Otherwise I should never have gone
near such a place, for which I was quite unsuited,
both in spirit and attire.</p>

<p>Contes is only fourteen miles or so from Nice
by a good road, and I thought I might pay my
visit, and in the afternoon get back into the hills
again. But crowning the ridge opposite to the
one I had come down the night before was the
old deserted town of Châteauneuf, and in the
soft early morning sunshine it looked so attractive
that I thought I would go up to it, and walk
down to Nice along the valley on the other side.</p>

<p>It was a steep and stony climb. When I got
a little way up I was already glad I had embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
upon it, for if I had gone down by the
road I should have missed the glorious view
I had looking back upon Contes, and upon Berre
on its wooded height far above it. I saw now
that Contes itself was a most picturesque little
town on a hill of its own, crowned by the spire
of its church, that its outlying houses ran straggling
up the higher slope down which I had
come, and that the inn at which I had slept was
in another little group right at the bottom of
the hill. It was not nearly so large as it had
seemed to me in the dark, but it was wonderfully
picturesque, from whatever shifting point of view
I saw it.</p>

<p>I sat for half an hour outside a little inn before
I climbed the last steep slope to the ruins above
me. They loomed big and massive, and I asked
why the place had been deserted. Owing to lack
of water, they told me, but there was still a
woman who inhabited it with her children, and
had some small "lands" to cultivate thereabouts.
There were a few little pocket handkerchiefs of
terraced soil among the lower ruined walls, and
some tall cypresses growing among the scattered
stones. But it was a scene of desolation when
one went along what had been a street or lane
of the village. The ruin was too far advanced to
tell many stories, and only the glorious view, which
embraced the sea to the south and all the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
panorama of the hills and distant mountains elsewhere,
made the reward of the climb.</p>

<p>A ragged child came running towards me over
the stones. I "posed" him among the ruins
which were his habitation, and asked him questions
about them, which he did not answer. I
found his mother, with some smaller children, in
a dwelling not so very uncomfortable, and she
was pleasant with me, and said there was no
lack of water at all in Châteauneuf, and it was
a convenient enough place to live in, and cheap.</p>

<p>There was not much to stay there for. The
ragged child was instructed to take me to some
grotto or other which his mother said was well
worth seeing, and he did accompany me a few
hundred yards on my way down the other side
of the hill; but I saw nothing of any grotto, and
presently he went back again.</p>

<p>A depression of spirit came upon me as I
walked down the road to Nice, which, however,
was picturesque enough, passing for some distance
through a narrow gorge with a foaming
river running along the bottom of it. But there
were people in carriages and motor-cars, and
presently there were tram-lines and untidy-looking
buildings such as always hang on to the skirts
of a French town. I was coming into a sort of
civilization that I wanted none of at that time.
I cut short the approach by taking a tram, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
will say nothing more of Nice except that I spent
the rest of the day and the night there.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to get out of it the
next morning, and in fact its atmosphere seemed
to hang about me all day. I walked along the
pavement of the interminable Promenade des
Anglais, drank coffee at an <i>auberge</i> somewhere
at the end of it, and then took a tram to Cagnes,
where they play golf. I must not be taken to
throw scorn upon Nice because it did not happen
to be the sort of place I wanted at that particular
time. It is the chief of the pleasure cities of
that sunny flowery coast, and was so when all
the rest were mere fishing villages. It is bright
and gay, and fronts its curving shore with a
flaunting elaboration of architecture that spells
wealth and luxury down to the smallest eccentric
pavilion. And this wealth and luxury spreads
its influence for miles around.</p>

<p>It was evident in the little <i>café restaurant</i> at
which I rested early in the afternoon, which was
just off the dusty high road to Grasse, and was
continually passed by motor-cars speeding along
in either direction. It was not a place at which
any of them were ever likely to stop, but I was
charged at least double prices for the mild refreshment
that I took, and when I had paid for
it was requested to leave as soon as possible, for
the lady of the house wished to shut it up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
go and wash at the fountain. I was sitting outside,
and could only have carried off a chair and
a table if I had been minded to carry off anything,
but I was not to be allowed to sit there a little
longer. She had got my money and wanted to
see my back.</p>

<p>I walked on, into the land of flowers&mdash;flowers
grown not for their beauty but for their scent,
and grown in terraced fields, just like any other
crop. Grasse, the centre of the industry, draws
supplies for its scents and soaps, pomades and
oils, from miles of country around it, and I was
getting near to Grasse.</p>

<p>There were great plantations of roses, all carefully
pruned and trained on low trellises, but
not yet in flower. Sometimes the rows were interspersed
with vines, and many of the fields
were bordered with mulberries. There were ledges
covered with the green foliage of violets, and
great double heads of purple, scented bloom peeping
out of it. There were fields of jasmine, of
tuberoses; terraces of lavender, of lilies of the
valley, carnations, mignonette; gardens of orange
trees, grown more for their flowers than for their
fruit; and of course groves of olives, of which
the oil forms so important a part in the local
manufactures. This day and the next day I
walked for miles with the scent of flowers all
about me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>I climbed up to another Châteauneuf; there
must be a round dozen of them in Provence alone,
and they are all very old. This was another most
picturesque hill town, and again I thought I
might get a bed there. But I could get no such
thing, and after sitting for half an hour on a
terrace and enjoying the wide view I set out again
as the sun sank behind the hills to walk to Grasse.</p>

<p>I had come up by a wide sweeping road, and
took a short cut down through the olive groves
to where I thought I should strike it again. But
my sense of direction, never very strong, failed
me altogether, and I don't know where I might
have wandered to if I had not frequently caught
sight of the lights of Grasse in the distance.
Presently I seemed to be going right away from
them, but between me and them there was a
deep valley, and I knew that the road which I
ought to have taken, or found again, kept to the
level on my right. So I turned, to round the
slope of the hill which would take me on to it.</p>

<p>I wandered for an hour up paths and down
paths and along the edges of terraces where there
were no paths, but keeping my face generally to
the right quarter. The lights of Grasse shone more
and more plainly between the tree-trunks, but
were still a very long way off. Sometimes I came
across little secluded farms, and in the garden
of one of them a great stretch of yellow jonquil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
shone in the dusk like a square of sunshine left
behind from the departed day, and its fragrance
followed me for a long way. From another a
dog barked and somewhat alarmed me, for dogs
are not to be lightly regarded in this country.
Later on I should have been more alarmed still,
for reasons which will presently appear. But this
dog did no more than bark savagely, and bye and
bye, when it was quite dark, I came out onto the
road, not so very far from Châteauneuf, round
which I had walked almost in full circle.</p>

<p>I was still four miles or so from Grasse, but
had no wish to walk there if I could find my
dinner and bed closer at hand, and just beyond
where I had come out onto the road there was
an inn, in which I got both. I think this place
was called Pré du Lac, but am not sure.</p>

<p>I dined in the <i>café</i>, which was so large as to
take up nearly the whole of the ground floor.
There was a billiard table in it, but it was in a
corner and seemed to make small impression on
the floor space. As I sat at my table against a
wall, the people of the inn dined at another one,
pushed up against an iron stove, and at such a
distance from mine that we had to raise our voices
in talking to one another.</p>

<p>They were an interesting group, but I had
some difficulty in making out their relationship.
There was a woman at the head of things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
bustling and voluble, who brought me one special
dish, which she said was a <i>plat du pays</i>, and not
given to every guest. I have forgotten all about
it, except that it was good. There was a man
with one eye who may have been her husband,
but I think he was only a friend of the family.
There was a married daughter, rather handsome,
with a small child who went to sleep over his
macaroni. These sat at the table. But there were
besides, a son, who was to be off on his military
service the next day, and a girl who may have
been a younger daughter. She wore a boy's cloth
cap and a black skirt, and looked very much like
a Kentish hop-picker. These two hovered about
the scene. There were also people coming in
now and then, to bring something or to take something
away, and they all stayed for a word or
two before going out into the night, and slamming
the door.</p>

<p>One man, who had just cut his beard very
short, or else had not shaved for a week, came
to fill a bottle with wine. He stood for a minute
or two by the table, talking loudly, and then
made for the door, still talking. By the time
he reached it he had found something to say
that took him back to the table, where he stayed
for another two or three minutes. Then he went
to the door again, stood there as before, and came
back. He did this six or seven times. He first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
came in as I finished my soup, and finally left
us as I was peeling my orange, and I am quite
sure that he pictured himself as having stopped
just to say a word, and told his wife so when
he got home with the wine for their meal.</p>

<p>I watched them as they sat and stood there,
talking vociferously, and frequently all at the
same time, and thought how different they were
from our northern peasantry. They live far better;
the poorest of them have well-cooked food
and wholesome natural wine as a matter of course.
Their ideas flow more freely, and they take a
great delight in imparting them. They are not
so much under the domination of richer men.
One could not, in England, walk through the
country and drop down to the way of life of
the peasantry without a conscious and possibly
irksome process of self-adjustment&mdash;as irksome
to them as to oneself. There one lives exactly
as they do, and lives better than in most middle-class
houses in England; and they will talk to you
freely, and interest you.</p>

<p>I went over and sat at their table, while the
one-eyed man and the married daughter played a
game of cards, which they explained to me but
I did not understand, and offered me most fragrant
coffee, from the stove at the lady's elbow.
The <i>patronne</i> came in, and gave me a liqueur
glass of rum, which she said would be good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
me. A handsome young man in the clothes of
a plasterer came in and watched the card game,
and another rather older man joined the circle,
together with the son and the girl in the cloth
cap, who had carried off the sleeping child and
put him to bed. She was smoking a cigarette.
I suggested that the rum should go round to my
order, but only the <i>patronne</i> herself, the one-eyed
man and the young plasterer accepted it.
The budding soldier would have done so, but his
mother forbade him.</p>

<p>The talk was of military service, as it had
been throughout the evening. They all disliked
the new three years' law, except the one-eyed
man, who said that soldiering was all fun and
no work, and you saw the world. But they cried
out at him that he had never done military service,
and he subsided and helped himself largely to
counters out of the pool.</p>

<p>They were all as genial as possible with me,
looked at my map with interest, and suggested
various places that I might visit. The conscript
presently showed me up to my room, which was
bare but clean, and asked me how many handkerchiefs
I had with me. I thought it was rather
a personal question, but showed them to him,
and he deluged each one with a different scent.
He said they were the best scents that could be
obtained in or around Grasse, and they were certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
very strong. For some days thereafter my
"essences turned the live air sick," and one of the
handkerchiefs now, after several washings, retains
a faint commemorative odour. But the attention
I valued, though the scent I came to dislike extremely.</p>

<p>They were nice people, all of them, though a
little greedy, as next morning's settling up
showed. But I was still on the high road between
Nice and Grasse, and I suppose was fair
game.</p>

<p>The weather was still lovely as I set out early
in the morning, and Grasse was a sight to see,
with its towers and roofs lit up by the sun, as
it stood on its dominating height over the wide
valley, in which the light mists still lingered.</p>

<p>I walked right through the town, but if I had
not already seen something of the processes by
which the scents from the miles of flowery fields
through which I was passing are extracted and
hoarded, I think I should have stayed to do so.
For I am so constituted that every manufacturing
process remains a complete and insoluble mystery
to me until I have seen it, and yet arouses
my curiosity and my willing interest.</p>

<p>It was about this time of the year that I had
visited one of the light, airy factories of Grasse.
I remember a huge, scented mass of the heads
of violets heaped up on a white sheet on one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the upstairs floors. It was half as high as I was,
and smelt divinely. These were the only flowers
in evidence, for the full harvest, when all the
great space of this chamber would be covered
with gathered blossoms, was not yet. But there
were sacks of lavender there besides, and bundles
of sweet-scented roots&mdash;orris, and patchouli, and
<i>vétiver</i>&mdash;which can be turned into essences as
sweet as those taken from the flowers themselves.</p>

<p>I remember in other rooms boiling vats, very
clean, and bright copper vessels, and great stills;
and casks full of the fine grease which is used to
catch and hold the distilled essences. It is spread
on sheets of glass, framed in wood, like school
slates, which are stacked in tiers; and other tiers
hold the wooden trays for the flower-heads ready
to be treated. And of course there were great
stores of attractive flasks and bottles, all labelled
and ribboned, and ready to take their places in
the shops of Bond Street or the Rue de la Paix,
and every other place where there is a market for
them.</p>

<p>There was a room, too, with machinery for
turning out scented soap. You saw a soft fat
pink deliciously-smelling roll squeezed out of a
press, and in no time sections were cut off and
stamped in another press into cakes ready for the
toilet table.</p>

<p>I must confess that I have only the dimmest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
idea now as to the actual details of the various
processes by which the scent of the flowers is
stoppered up into the aristocratic bottles, but I
have seen it all done, and the impression remains
on my mind that any scent that bears a label
from Grasse does come from the flowers themselves,
and with no adulteration that I could see
anywhere.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>In Old Provence</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">I now finally left behind me the cosmopolitan
coast, and came into the true Provence.</p>

<p>My objective was the old city of Aix, which
lay almost due east, across country in which there
are not many places standing out on the map as
of any importance, but which seemed to me rather
more attractive on that account.</p>

<p>Once at Aix, one would be in the thick of it.
Avignon, Nîmes, Arles, and a score of points of
interest lie within a few miles of one another.
When I reached this rich and crowded corner,
the adventure of walking through unknown country
would take second place. But at least as
long as the weather held I wanted to be on foot,
and in the country that lies apart from the main
tourist routes.</p>

<p>When I had passed beyond the sphere of the
villas with their flowery gardens the road became
rather lonely. The fields of blossom became
rarer, but there were vines and olives everywhere.
The earth was red, and looked rich, and
the hills on either side of me took on all sorts
of lovely shades of orange and purple and blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as the light changed and shifted during the day.
I could still see, when I turned round, some of
the higher mountains from among which I had
come, and the country did not sensibly change its
character until I had crossed another pass later
on in the day.</p>

<p>I walked for some miles, hoping to come across
an inn where I could get something to drink.
I had had nothing since the bread and coffee of
the early morning, and had walked straight
through Grasse, only stopping to get my letters
and buy some provisions.</p>

<p>I believe that most people on the tramp find
it enough to have one good meal at the end
of the day. Some of them find it necessary to
start with a stout breakfast, but that is hardly
possible outside England, and for my part the
coffee and roll of France or Switzerland carries
me on very well for two or three hours,
when I am ready for something more substantial.</p>

<p>You need not trust to an inn for this second
collation, and if you do they will only send out
to get for you what you could have got for yourself,
and charge you rather more for it. They
quite understand your bringing your own <i>vivres</i>
with you, and eating them to the accompaniment
of their wine. Even the wine you can buy and
carry with you, but it is hardly necessary to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that as long as you are in a country where you
can get it anywhere.</p>

<p>You go to a <i>boulangerie</i> and buy a crisp,
newly baked loaf for a penny. Then you go
to an <i>épicerie</i> and buy cheese or sausage, or both;
also oranges and chocolate to amuse yourself
with at odd moments during the day. Here is
food fit for the gods, and all you want is wine
to wash it down with. My own preference is
for a great deal of wine at such times, but there
are some who may be content with water. I want
water, too, and a great deal of that, and carry
an aluminum folding cup with me, filling it almost
anywhere without regard to possible germs.
It may be dangerous in some places, and possibly
so in Provence; but I have never taken any
harm from it, there or anywhere.</p>

<p>It was on this morning that I realized for
the first time that it was not necessary to find
an inn in order to find wine. Everybody makes
wine in Provence and almost anybody will sell
it to you. I got my litre at a blacksmith's; they
brought me out a chair under a tree, and I ate and
drank to the ring of the anvil. The wine cost
fourpence halfpenny&mdash;I like to present these
little sums in English money&mdash;and was drinkable,
but no more. I was beginning to get rather tired
of the ordinary red wine of the country, though
I never drank white that was not good. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it is mostly red wine that the peasants make,
and it is only occasionally that it is anything
more than a mere beverage.</p>

<p>That afternoon I came to a beautiful place.
The road had been falling for some time, and
at last entered a deep and narrow valley of
verdant meadows through which flowed a very
clear river. I had walked a long way, and it
was very hot. The idea came to me to find a
sheltered spot and bathe in these clear waters.
Perhaps fortunately, there was an inn at the
point at which the road crossed a bridge and
doubled back on the other side of the gorge,
and when I had refreshed myself there bathing
did not seem such a reasonable undertaking. The
river, though invitingly clear, was rapid, and
must have been fed by snows not so very far
away; and it was still early March, in spite of
the hot sun.</p>

<p>There were motor-cars in front of this inn,
and a party had finished a late and from evidence
a long <i>déjeuner</i> at a table in the open. They
were flushed with food and wine and other liquors,
and chattered like parrots before they packed
themselves into their cars and made off in the
direction of the coast. I disliked them one and
all, and felt vastly superior to them&mdash;a feeling
which no doubt they also experienced towards
me, if they took any notice of me at all. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sensation of superiority would be based upon
the fact that they were showing themselves in
command of quite a lot of money, and would
be heightened by the mild delirium that comes
from over-feeding and being carried along swiftly
in that state, with no call for bodily or mental
effort. Mine arose from the pride of living frugally
and feeling particularly well from having
walked a good many miles and being ready to
walk a good many more in about half an hour's
time. I'm not sure, now that I have drawn the
comparison, that the one feeling was any more
laudable than the other.</p>

<p>I crossed the bridge, which was called the Pont
de la Saigne, and began the long ascent to the
Colle Noire. When I had reached it the scenery
began to show a change. I had left the high
rugged hills behind me at last, and was dropping
down into a fertile valley, which spread out into
a plain. The hills, more rounded now, bounded
this plain to the north, and were dotted at intervals
with little towns that showed up picturesquely
from a distance on their blue and purple
slopes. I was making for one of them&mdash;Fayence,
where I had been assured that I should find a
good inn. It was still a long way off after a
few hours' walk, and still hidden from me by
an intervening hill, and I had walked quite far
enough that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>I sat down on the coping of a bridge as the
dusk began to steal over the fields and hills.
It was a peaceful, soothing scene. An old shepherd
came slowly towards me with his flock following
him to their night's shelter. It was like
a picture by Millet. There was not enough light
for a photograph, but I took one of another
shepherd with his flock later on. They watch their
sheep as the Swiss watch their cattle in the
mountain pastures, never leaving them alone; and
I never saw a flock of sheep in Provence that
numbered above thirty.</p>

<p>When I had walked on a little farther I got
a lift in a cart drawn by an old white horse
that was jogging along my way. It was driven
by a good-looking young man with a wonderful
set of teeth and a pleasant smile. He was a
sort of general carrier. He dropped a large
bundle of what looked like washing at one cottage
and a basket of provisions at another, and
a man stopped him on the road to hand in a
lantern for repair, and a woman at a railway
crossing asked for medicine to be brought the
next day. There was a little conversation on
general topics at every stop, and the tongue was
the true Provençal, which he told me they all
talked among themselves, though most of them
talked French as well.</p>

<p>Provençal is soft and sweet. It is not difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to make out its meaning in print if one knows
some Latin and some French, but I never succeeded
in catching more than the glimmer of an
idea of what was being talked about. Of Provençal
as a literary language there will be more
to say later on.</p>

<p>As we rounded the hill that had hidden Fayence,
there came into view a castle with two
towers that stood most imposingly on a summit
overlooking the valley; but as we approached it
turned out to be, not an ancient ruined keep as
it had seemed in the dusk, but a not very ancient
unfinished château of enormous proportions. It
had been built so far, my friend informed me, by a
General Fabre, or Favre, and, as I afterwards
learnt, about the year 1836. I made up my mind
to visit it the next day, for it showed up as a most
lordly pleasure house, with terraced gardens commanding
the great stretch of country between
the range of hills on which it stood, and the
mountains of the Estérel and the Maures towards
the sea.</p>

<p>Fayence lay just beyond it. My carrier was
going on to Seillans, and dropped me at the foot
of the hill, and I made my way slowly up a winding
road to my night's shelter.</p>

<p>I found a good inn where they gave me an
excellent dinner and a delicious white wine. The
dinner consisted of pea soup, a spit upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
was impaled alternate morsels of liver and bacon,
a dish of little sausages with succulent cabbage,
a dish founded on beef or mutton, I forget which,
cream cheese, biscuits, oranges, and nuts, and the
charge for this, including the wine, of which I
drank a large quantity, was two francs. My bed,
in a small clean room, was also two francs, and
coffee and rolls the next morning fifty centimes.
This comes to about three shillings and ninepence
for a day's living, apart from what one
consumes upon the road; and this was the
chief hotel in a town of fifteen hundred inhabitants.</p>

<p>Such hotels are common all over southern
France, and easy enough to find in a town not
too large or too small. They are not so well
furnished or so comfortable as an English inn
of the same class, but it would be rare indeed
to find an English inn where the food would be
so good. An evening meal would have to be ordered
or cooked specially, and one would consider
oneself charged moderately in a bill that
came to no more than three times as much. In
the bigger towns such hotels are more difficult
to find, but they are there if one knows where
to look for them, and has learnt exactly what
to look for. In the smaller places to which tourists
go, and there is no choice, the charges are
considerably higher; but one can usually get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bath, which is an unknown luxury in the ordinary
way of things.</p>

<p>I wish very much that I had not left these
wanderings on foot over foreign countries until
middle age. I can imagine no more delightful
experience for a young man, either alone or in
company. If I could go back to undergraduate
days, I would spend some part of every spring
and summer vacation on foot in this way. Ready
money is apt to be scarce at that happy age, but
it need cost so little.</p>

<p class="b1">My own experiences, for various reasons, are
no particular guide, but Mr. Hilaire Belloc, who
is pastmaster in the art of seeing fresh country,
is worth quoting on the subject. He wrote to
me when I asked him for advice before setting
out on this expedition:</p>


<p class="pbq">"I think the thing is quite easy if one only
remembers that the conditions, upon the Western
Continent at least, that is, in France, Italy and
Spain, are so different from those in England
that no one asks questions and no one dreams
of interfering with one's liberty. The rule is as
simple as possible. Any inn whatsoever in France
and almost any inn north of Naples in Italy gives
you a tolerable bed, and on entering it you ask
the price of a room and of coffee the next morning.
They are accustomed to the process and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
bargain with you. I have been to dozens of
places where I was charged no more than a franc.</p>

<p class="pbq">"For your mid-day meal you will be wise to
carry a leather bottle which the French call a
<i>Gourde</i> and the Spaniards a <i>Bota</i>, holding wine,
which again you must have filled in shops where
wine is sold retail. You will again do well to
ask before it is filled at what price the wine is
sold. I have carried a half-gallon <i>gourde</i> of
this kind over many journeys. It is slung from
the shoulders by a strap and is purchasable in
all the mountain countries. Bread is purchasable
everywhere, and that kind of sausage which the
French call by various names, which the Spaniards
call 'Salpicon' and the Italians 'Salami'
is common to all countries and is with cheese the
accompaniment of the meal. Your night meal
you must make the principal meal of the day,
and if you wish to save money eat it at some
place different from the place where you sleep.
Thus accoutred you can live indefinitely at a
rate of five francs a day and see all that there is
to be seen. Always carry upon your person in
such countries one good 'piece,' as they call it,
for identification, the best of which is a passport
issued by the British authorities wherever
you are. Be careful to have it <i>viséd</i> by the consul
of the countries where you are to travel. It is
the <i>visa</i> that counts more than the passport. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
instance, if you are starting from Switzerland
get such a document <i>viséd</i> by the consul in some
principal towns of France, Italy and Spain, then
you have nothing to fear.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Remember that telegrams or letters sent to you
at one place <i>poste restante</i> do not tie you to
going to that place. You have but to send a
message to the post office to have them forwarded
to another, and it will be done. But you cannot
get your letters, still less your registered letters,
at a <i>poste restante</i> without some such 'piece'
as I mentioned.</p>

<p class="pbq">"It is a good rule not to carry personal luggage
except in the smallest amount in your sack, and
to buy things as you need them. It is cheaper
in the long run."</p>

<p class="p1">Now five francs a day is not quite thirty shillings
a week, and for the price of a few days'
revel "in town" an enterprising youngster might
spend a fortnight walking through almost any
beautiful stretch of country in nearer Europe,
including his journey there and back to England.
However it may have been in the past, it is now
possible to travel third class on the Continent in
no more discomfort than in England, and indeed
in the holiday season third class is apt to be a
good deal less crowded than second, on the fast
trains in which third-class passengers are carried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
They are not carried, of course, in all trains; but
where the saving of shillings is an object it is
no particular hardship to spend a few hours more
on the way, and unless the journey is a very
long one the time lost is small and the money
saved considerable.</p>

<p>The burden to be carried is a more debatable
matter. Mr. Belloc's advice is worth a good deal
more than mine, but his early training in arms
must have used him to a less fearful regard of
discomfort than is possible with most of us. The
less you carry the easier your walking will be,
and I would never hamper myself with any protection
against rain. Unless you can keep your
legs as well as your body protected you must
occasionally expect to be under the necessity of
having something dried before a fire, and while
you are about it you may as well go to bed and
have everything dried. But I should not care to
be without a spare shirt, at least one pair of
spare socks, and a pair of light felt slippers,
and with other small necessaries for comfort and
a reasonable degree of cleanliness this already
makes up a fair weight. Let every one choose
for himself. My experience is that one very
quickly gets used to a moderate pack strapped
upon one's shoulders, and hardly notices it, except
for a time after one may have taken a day
off and walked about carrying nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>I took a day off at Fayence. It was Sunday,
although I had no idea of it until well on into
the morning.</p>

<p>I came down at about half past seven, and
found that the three <i>commis voyageurs</i> in whose
company I had dined the night before had already
finished their breakfast and gone out; but two of
them came in again as I was finishing mine, and
transacted serious business with some townspeople
whom they brought with them. They keep early
hours in France.</p>

<p>I walked up to the top of the hill upon which
the town is built, and found an old and very
solid tower with a clock in its face and a bell
in a cage of wrought iron on the top of it. The
clock had a date on it&mdash;1908&mdash;and I took some
little trouble to discover whether it could be seen
from any part of the town except by climbing up
to it as I had done. I found that it could not.
Then I made my way to the Château du Puy.</p>

<p>I approached it along a sort of drive, and
stood in a doorway looking down three stories
deep into the stone-built husks of enormous rooms,
and up into three or four stories more. There
was a series of great halls, one above the other,
in the main part of the building, and many rooms
opening out of them in both wings, which were
carried up into imposing towers; and there were
lateral extensions besides. The house seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
have been designed for the accommodation of a
regiment rather than one solitary general.</p>

<p>The gardens to the south of it were on a level
two stories lower, and the gate to them was
locked; but by a little scrambling I reached them.
The terraces had been laid out on a grand scale,
and gardening had been begun at some date or
other. There were overgrown beds of iris getting
ready to flower, and in one corner a <i>pièce d'eau</i>,
without which no French garden is complete. A
tall palm grew in one corner, and there were fig-trees
and bushes of hibiscus. In an extension of
the main building there were signs of habitation,
and an orange-tree bright with fruit grew in the
middle of a chicken-run. Olives and almonds had
been planted where the ordered garden should
have been, and most of the ground had been
made use of.</p>

<p>I had been able to get no information about
the building of this great pile; the tradition
seemed to have departed. I do not know whether
it had been stopped by the death of the owner,
or, as seems not improbable, by a lack of money
to go on. I imagined him, as I sat and smoked
in the deserted garden, as having thought continually
of this glorious site in his native country,
and coming back to it when his fighting was done
to build himself the finest house for many miles
around. I think he must have enjoyed himself
enormously while it was in the building, but not
without some doubts as to the way in which it
was to be lived in when it should at last be finished.</p>

<p class="p1">His site must have given him continual pleasure.
From his terraced garden the wide fertile
plain was spread out before him, in front and
on either side. As I saw it, it was all browns
and greens, threaded with white roads, and punctuated
by dark cypress spires. Miles away it was
bounded by pine-clad mountain slopes, beyond
which lay the sea. At the back of the house
the little town of Tourettes showed its huddle
of old roofs and walls a mile away, and behind
it the hills rose until snow could be seen on distant
summits. From the little side garden with
the fish pond, Fayence could be seen on its own
hillside, and a range of blue and purple hills
beyond it. The sun came out as I sat there, and
the shadows of clouds played all over the beautiful
scene. It was the true Provence, which gets
into the blood of those who are born in it, and
makes them think that no country in the world
is fairer.</p>

<p>I walked back to the town and went into the
church, a large eighteenth century structure of
some dignity, with an unornamented tower that
looks much older. The curé came in as I was
looking about me. He was as handsome and dignified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
as his church, with his white hair and portly
presence, and reminded me of Parson Irvine in
"Adam Bede." He was inclined to deprecate
my admiration of his church. It was large, yes,
not particularly fine, he thought. But I was
judging by other standards. A church as large
as this would hardly have been built in England
in the eighteenth century for a thriving town;
for one of the size of Fayence the idea of it would
have been laughed at.</p>

<p>It would hardly have been built in Fayence
a few years later. When I had gone out on to
the little <i>place</i> in front of it, where there were
busy market stalls under a row of giant planes,
and a view past the Château du Puy to the rich
plain and the mountains beyond it, I went back
into the church and watched the congregation
arrive for Mass. It was not until then that I
made it out to be Sunday. One enjoys a blessed
disregard of the calendar on such expeditions as
mine, walking on from day to day.</p>

<p>Women and children&mdash;they filled about a quarter
of the seats provided, and these filled hardly
more than half the church. There were two old
men besides, and one middle-aged one, who came
in with his family with an air of importance.
The rest of the male population of Fayence was
buying and selling outside in the market, or in
the shops, or talking together on the terrace steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
above the <i>place</i>, or in the <i>cafés</i>, or walking up
and down the steep streets.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon I walked over to Seillans,
and saw the populace of that town enjoying themselves
on a fine promenade that they have on the
edge of their hill. It is planted with the ubiquitous
shady plane, and overlooks the magnificent
view to the south.</p>

<p>A good many of the men were playing their
game of <i>boule</i>, which needs only a few yards of
hard ground, and some wooden balls about the
size of a cricket ball, studded closely with nails.
They throw a "jack" about fifteen or twenty
yards and then follow closely the rules of our
game of bowls. But they throw the ball with
the back of the hand up, and give it a spin which
makes it run on after it has fallen. When all
of them do no more than this the game is dull
enough, at least to watch, although the inequalities
of the ground give it some interest to the players.
But the good players will aim at coming right
down upon an adversary's ball and punching it
away out of danger. They bend down very low
with the right leg curiously crooked, and then
run forward fast and spin the ball in the air.
It looks a most difficult shot, but I saw it brought
off many times by these players at Seillans.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Draguignan and Saint-Maximin</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Early on Monday morning I set out to walk
to Draguignan, which lay on the other side of
a range of hills to the southwest, at a distance
of about twenty-two miles. I kept to the high
road all the way, but did not pass a single village,
although the land was cultivated almost
everywhere, with olives, vines, mulberries and
cereals. The only episode of a rather dull walk
that remains in my memory is a chat with a very
stout proprietor of vineyards, who sold me a litre
of his <i>bon vin</i> for fourpence. He said that his
wine was very wholesome, and I had no fault
to find with any of its qualities, except possibly
that of taste. He talked to me about Mistral,
the poet. He had seen him, and said he was
a very great man; but he did not seem to have
read his poems. There was to be a big Provençal
<i>fête</i> at Draguignan in May, and Mistral would
be there, as gay as any of them, in spite of his
eighty-four years. But alas! Mistral's death was
to move all this country for which he had done
so much in little more than a week from that
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on that day that the wind, from which
the poet's family took its name, and which so
vexes the plains of Provence, began to blow. I
did not recognize it at first. The sun still shone
brightly in a blue sky, and I was rather glad
of the strong clean wind that cooled me as I
walked. There is something about the name
<i>mistral</i> that had seemed to me to connote an
unhealthful fever-bringing air. I suppose I had
unconsciously connected it with the word "malarial."
But the <i>mistral</i> of Provence is the
<i>magistral</i>, the great master-wind from the north
or the north-east, which rushes down from the Alps
and Cevennes to replace the hot air that rises
from the sun-baked plains in the great Rhône
delta. It is like our east wind, keen and strong,
and seems to deprive the air of all moisture, and
to make even a cloudless sky look cold.</p>

<p>I first saw Draguignan some four miles away,
as I rounded the shoulder of a hill. It is the
capital of the Department of Var, having replaced
Toulon, which now has more than ten
times its population, at the end of the eighteenth
century. Baedeker describes it as an <i>assez belle
ville</i>, but it was not <i>assez belle</i> for me. I thought
it the dullest possible sort of town, although there
were picturesque "bits" in the streets of the
older quarter. The first thing that struck the
eye as I neared it was an enormous range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
new barracks, with a huge barrack square. The
bugles were blowing gaily, and when I came to
the town it was alive with soldiers in dirty white,
with dark-blue waist sashes, puttees and tam-o'-shanters.
As I walked up the narrow streets of
the old town into the untidy-looking newer part,
I could not help comparing it with another French
military city that I had visited some months before.
This was Besançon, the brightest, cleanest,
pleasantest large town that I have seen in the
whole of France, and I have seen a good many.
Perhaps it was hardly fair to compare the two,
for I was in Besançon on a fine mellow September
day, and Draguignan must have been about
at its worst, with the <i>mistral</i> tearing along its
streets, filling the eyes with dust and making the
pavements look as if all the waste paper and light
rubbish of the town were habitually thrown on to
them.</p>

<p>And they were pruning the plane-trees. No
one who has not visited the south of France when
this operation is going on can form any idea of
what it means. These trees are planted everywhere,
and in summer give a most welcome shade
to the hot streets and the wide squares of the
bigger towns. They grow to an immense girth,
and those in Draguignan were especially fine.
The way they prune them, from the very first
time of their planting, shows that they know very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
well what they are about, for they get a wide
spread of branch and an even and impenetrable
roof of green. The trees are never allowed to
get out of hand, and are kept at school when
they have passed the span of the longest human
life. With ladders and saws and ropes they
remove great branches with as little concern as
one cuts into a rose-bush. The reward comes
in the summer, but an avenue or a "square" of
these trees in March, when the saws have been
at work upon them, is a desolating sight. Those
that I photographed the next morning are umbrageous
compared with some. I have seen far
bigger planes than these kept to three branches,
each as big as a good-sized tree.</p>

<p>I read in the official Directory of the Department
of Var that towards the end of the fifth
century the town was infested by an enormous
dragon (symbol of heresy). The inhabitants had
recourse to St. Hermentaire, Bishop of Antibes,
who delivered them from the monster. To perpetuate
the memory of this happy disencumbrance
the town changed its ancient name of Griminum
to that of Dragonia, from which has come
Draguignan. And St. Hermentaire has been regarded
with affection in the locality ever since,
though his name is little known outside of it.</p>

<p>I had been recommended by my friends among
the <i>commis voyageurs</i> at Fayence to an hotel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the right sort. I should certainly have passed it
by but for that, for it seemed to be nothing but
a large restaurant, not of the first order nor
even of the second, and there was nothing to show
that it had much accommodation elsewhere. But
when I asked for a bedroom, and suggested two
francs for it instead of two and a half, I was
introduced to a noble apartment, which reminded
me of the pictures one sees in the illustrated
papers, when His Majesty the King is put up
for a few days at an Embassy abroad. It was
very large, and the furniture was old, and some
of it handsome, especially the bed, which had
more in the way of canopy and curtains than I
am accustomed to. The lady of the house told
me afterwards that she kept a shop of antiquities
in the town, which accounted for some of the
unusual splendour. I felt ashamed at paying no
more than one and eightpence for the privilege
of sleeping in such a room.</p>

<p>The dinner was the same price, and included
a bottle of white wine that was worth thinking
about as one drank it. A good many men came
in to dine, at any time between half past seven
and half past eight. Very few of them looked
to be above the rank of a workman, and all of
them kept on their hats as they ate. They sat
in groups at different tables, and enjoyed themselves
in much the same way as men do in a club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
in London. Probably they paid even less for
the same dinner than I did, and I hope their wives
had as good a one at home.</p>

<p>The <i>mistral</i> blew as keenly as ever the next
morning, and I determined to cut off a bit of the
distance by train. I wanted to get to some of
the interesting places, which are nearly all in
the west of Provence. It was a two days'
march to Saint-Maximin, where there is a noble
church, but I thought I would sleep there that
night.</p>

<p>The train did not start until half past nine.
I had time to walk out a few miles on the other
side of Draguignan to see a famous dolmen, the
only remains of prehistoric life to be found in
this immediate region.</p>

<p>It was a curious well-preserved structure, hard
by a little farmhouse just off the road. I paid
a youth who said he was the proprietor fifty centimes
for the privilege of looking at it, but thought
his demand for a further two francs because I
had photographed it unreasonable. He blustered,
but made no effort to detain me as I walked off
the field with the two francs in my pocket instead
of his. I had already been asked once or twice
if I was travelling for the purpose of taking picture
postcards, and probably that was his idea.
But he was a potential robber all the same, and
I doubt if he was the proprietor at all. I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
I had thought of threatening him with St. Hermentaire.</p>

<p>It took three hours to cover the thirty miles
to Barjols, where I took the road again at half
past twelve. Barjols is quite out of the beaten
track, although this pottering little line, which
eventually reaches Arles, passes near it. As I
walked through a very wide <i>place</i> I stopped to
ask a group of school children playing marbles
which was my route. At the sound of my voice
they scattered away with every sign of alarm,
and I laughed at them and went on, with my
vanity rather wounded at being regarded as an
object of terror.</p>

<p>When I had gone a mile down the hill I met
a man in his best clothes reading a newspaper.
I had seen the start of a funeral procession in
Barjols, and I supposed him to have the intention
of joining it at his own convenience. He asked
me where I was going, and told me I could
cut off four kilometres if I followed the route
he would describe to me. He took immense trouble
about it, and it was a kindly thought, but I
wished afterward that he had not had it, although
I found his interest in me soothing after having
so lately been run away from.</p>

<p>I left the road bye and bye and followed the
path that he had indicated, but, as generally happens
in such circumstances, it soon ceased to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
a path at all, and I found myself wandering
among the hills with a very small idea of where
I was on the map. There was frequent cultivation,
but very few signs of habitation, and I saw
no living soul until I struck the high road again
more than two hours later. It was not the high
road I had expected, and left me about eleven
miles to do out of what would have been a total
of fifteen if my adviser had been punctual at
the funeral. The road to Saint-Maximin was
quite straight for the last three miles, and I
saw the long line of the great church standing
high above the roofs of the town from far away.</p>

<p>I approached Saint-Maximin with an agreeable
sense of anticipation. The learned M. Rostan
considers that its church shows the fairest page
of Gothic art in the South, and to be the only
religious monument of real architectural importance
in Provence. This is perhaps extravagant
praise, but it was at any rate the first big thing
of its kind that I was to see. I had surveyed the
country at large for a week, and was ready for
a different sort of interest, especially as the <i>mistral</i>
had blown steadily all day long and walking
was beginning to lose the edge of its rapture.</p>

<p>It is not only the architectural beauties of this
noble church that give it its interest. It is its
connection with a tradition that has left its marks
all over Provence, and in past centuries has met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
with such universal acceptance that it is small
wonder that innumerable people firmly believe in
it to this day. Saint-Maximin was the first place
to which I came that had to do with it.</p>

<p>I read about it that evening sitting before a
wood fire in a room more comfortable than is
to be found in most French inns. I had come
in to Saint-Maximin as dusk was beginning to
fall and had gone straight to the church. But it
was closed for the night. All I saw was the
disappointing west front, which has never been
finished. So I betook me to the hotel. Saint-Maximin
is a town of small importance in the
present day, but it contains a good one, something
like an old English coaching inn, both in
appearance and custom. It was a pleasant change
to dine in a medium-sized parlour instead of a
large bare <i>café</i>, and to find a fire in it; for the
<i>mistral</i> had blown away all the warmth in the air
and was blowing still.</p>

<p>Possibly it was from this inn that Lucien Bonaparte
married his first wife, who was the daughter
of an <i>aubergiste</i> of Saint-Maximin, where at the
age of twenty-one he administered the military
provisions of the Revolutionary army. The Revolutionists,
disliking any name inclusive of Saint,
called the town Marathon, but it reverted later.</p>

<p>So I sat very late before the fire and read
about Saint-Maximin and about the legend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the three Marys. It must have been after ten
o'clock when I took my candle and went up to
bed. Here is the story, adapted from the learned
M. Rostan, who made a life study of the antiquities
of Provence and especially of Saint-Maximin,
and whose memory is deservedly held in
honour throughout the country.</p>

<p>After the death of Jesus Christ and his divine
resurrection, the Jews, alarmed by the rapid progress
made by the new faith in Jerusalem, began
a terrible persecution, for which the martyrdom of
St. Stephen was, so to speak, the signal. They
threw into a boat, without sails, oars or rudder,
the following saints: Mary Magdalene,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Lazarus
and Martha with their servant Marcelle, Sidonius,
the man who was born blind, Maximin, one of
the seventy-two disciples, Mary the wife of Cleophas,
and Mary the wife of Zebedee, also called
Salome, and several others, including Sarah the
black servant of these last two Marys, Trophimus,
and Joseph of Arimathea.</p>

<p>(The list extended itself as the legend grew,
for it almost certainly began with three only, as
we shall see later. But M. Rostan includes most
of the above.)</p>

<p>The illustrious confessors were exposed to what
seemed a certain and horrible death, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sacred barque, far from being overwhelmed by the
waves, floated in a calm that spread immediately
around it, and protected by the mercy of Providence
on its long and perilous voyage, touched at
last the shores of Provence at the mouth of the
Rhône, at the place now called Saintes-Maries,
or Notre Dame de la Mer.</p>

<p>Mary the mother of James the Less, and
Salome stayed in that place with their black
servant Sarah. The other holy men and women
spread themselves over different parts of the country
and diligently preached their religion. St.
Maximin went to Aix, of which he was the first
bishop, St. Martha to Tarascon, which she delivered
from the ravages of a horrible monster,
St. Lazarus and St. Mary Magdalene to Marseilles.</p>

<p>Now although the church and town of Saint-Maximin
bear the name of that illustrious saint
their chief glory is of a still greater. St. Mary
Magdalene made herself celebrated at Marseilles,
then one of the chief cities of the world, by her
preaching. After having made numerous converts
and performed striking miracles, she went to Aix,
where she was named in the charter of the Church
of St. Saviour as co-founder with the bishop,
St. Maximin. After some years she formed a
wish to take refuge from the eyes of the world,
and betook herself to the heart of the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mountain forest now called Sainte-Baume, because
of the cave in which she passed the last
thirty years of her life in the practice of the
most austere penitence. Seven times a day angels
came to her in this wild retreat and exalted her
to the summit of the mountain, so that her ears
might be ravished by the celestial harmonies. As
her last moments approached they transported
her some distance from Sainte-Baume near to an
obscure spot in which St. Maximin was then in
retreat. She received the last sacraments at his
hands, and a few days later breathed her last
sigh, leaving behind her, says the Golden Legend,
"an odour so sweet that the oratory was perfumed
by it for seven days." Her mortal remains
were reverently interred, and her tomb
became thenceforward an object of remarkable
devotion. Shortly afterwards the holy Prelate
himself, with others of the blessed saints, was
buried at her side, and above these sacred remains
arose a church that became from that time
a place of pilgrimage and deep veneration.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the invasions of the Saracens
in the eighth century should have made it
impossible to produce documentary evidence of
any of this earlier than that date, for those barbarians
devastated everything. Seven or eight
hundred years is a big gap to cover, and when
we begin to look into profane history the gap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
becomes much bigger; for the legend cannot be
traced earlier than the translation of the relics
of St. Trophimus in the twelfth century, and did
not receive general acceptance until three hundred
years later still. But since that time it has
exercised an immense power upon the imagination
of Christendom.</p>

<p>M. Rostan, who was an antiquarian of note,
believed in it. He summons in evidence the stones
of Saint-Maximin itself. In 1859, when the
church was undergoing restoration, he examined
a brick-built tomb which was incontestably of the
date of the early Christian era, and "might well
be the primitive burial-place of one of the holy
personages venerated on this spot." It is true
that the tomb was empty, but the sacred relics
are stated to have been removed after the persecutions
of the fifth century into the sarcophagi
which are there to this day. The walls of the
crypt also, exposed in course of further restoration
thirty years ago, convinced M. Rostan, who
saw them uncovered, that this was "the veritable
Cubiculum, the sepulchral chamber of St. Magdalene,
not only in its plan and dimensions, but
in its still living reality, as it existed when the
celebrated penitent was buried there, and where
they placed her sarcophagus in the fourth or fifth
century after the triumph of the Church. The
vaulting alone is not the same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of all of which the sceptic may at least
accept the fact, interesting enough, that the crypt
as it stands is of the date at which St. Mary Magdalene
probably died.</p>

<p>When the Saracens were burning all the
churches, and scattering all the sacred relics that
they could lay hands upon, the Cassianite monks
who had been in charge of these peculiarly holy
ones for three hundred years, filled the crypt of
their church with earth so as to hide it, and for
further precaution moved the bones of St. Mary
Magdalene from their tomb in the place of honour
into that previously occupied by those of Sidonius,
where they remained for five hundred years.</p>

<p>So far, then, we have in evidence the tradition
of the landing of this company of saints on the
shores of Provence and their subsequent missions,
not from St. Maximin alone, but also from Aix,
Marseilles, Tarascon and Saintes-Maries, in each
of which places are monuments to their glory.
We have also the evidence of a burial-place
of the first century which was an object of veneration
at that time and remained so thereafter.</p>

<p>It is true that during the epoch of the Crusades
the magnificent church of Vezelay in Burgundy,
in which Bernard of Clairvaux preached
and Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion took the vows, attracted
to itself great honour by its claim to
possess the true relics of St. Mary Magdalene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
But M. Rostan points out that this belief on the
part of Vezelay, so far from being in flagrant
contradiction to the Provençal tradition, confirms
it; for the monks of the Abbey of Vezelay attributed
the possession of these sacred relics to the
piety of their founder, Gérard de Roussillon, who
was Count and Governor of Provence under the
Emperor Lothair. "But as the body of St.
Magdalene had not been visible at Saint Maximin
for a long time, and the precise spot in which
it was hidden was not known, the statement of
Vezelay was believed, and conferred great celebrity
upon it as a place of pilgrimage, until the
moment when it entered the designs of Providence
to clear up the mystery that enveloped the tomb
of the glorious saint and dispel all uncertainty
upon the subject of her relics."</p>

<p>The instrument of this discovery was the Prince
of Salerno, known later as Charles II, King of
Sicily and Count of Provence, who was the son
of Charles of Anjou, the belligerent brother of
St. Louis.</p>

<p class="b1">It was in 1279. While Charles I was fighting
in Italy, his son, then at Aix, moved by a great
devotion towards St. Mary Magdalene and a lively
desire to recover her relics, betook himself to
Saint-Maximin in order to have excavations made
beneath the pavement of the church. He put
himself at the head of the workers, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
ninth day of September had the singular happiness
of uncovering the ancient sarcophagus which
held the venerated body. Restraining the zeal of
his assistants the prince put his seal on the tomb,
and at once summoned a convocation of prelates
to witness the exhumation of the sacred bones,
which took place on the eighteenth day of the
same month. In the dust of the tomb was discovered
a box of cork enclosing an inscription on
parchment or papyrus, which, translated from the
Latin, runs thus:</p>

<p class="pbq">"In the year of our Lord 716, in the month
of December, very secretly in the night, when
the most pious Odo was king of the French, at
the time of the invasion of the perfidious nation
of the Saracens, this body of the most dear and
revered Mary Magdalene was translated from
its own tomb of alabaster into this one of marble,
out of fear of the said perfidious nation of the
Saracens, because it is more secret here, the body
of Sidonius having been removed."</p>

<p class="p1">Contemporary historians unanimously report
the miraculous circumstances that accompanied
the discovery. All make mention of the delicious
odour that came from the sarcophagus when it
was opened. They tell, too, how a verdant plant
of fennel grew from the tongue of the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
penitent, whose body had not yet known corruption.
The <i>noli me tangere</i>, the spot on the forehead
which the Saviour had touched, was in a
perfect state of preservation. Among the eminent
churchmen who vouched for the miraculous
events that surrounded the disinternment was the
Cardinal de Cabassoles, Petrarch's friend, whose
country retreat at Vaucluse we shall visit later.</p>

<p>Prince Charles caused a magnificent reliquary
to be made at Aix to hold the head of the saint.
It was of silver gilt, in the form of a hollow bust,
into which the skull was fitted. The face and the
hair were of gold, and it was surmounted by a
gold crown set with precious stones.</p>

<p>In the next year Prince Charles was taken prisoner
by Peter of Aragon, and shut up in Barcelona
for four years. He attributed his deliverance
and the restoration of his kingdom&mdash;his
father having died in the meantime&mdash;to the influence
of St. Mary Magdalene, and set in hand
the building of a church at Saint-Maximin which
should be more worthy of the holy relics it contained.
But it was not until more than two hundred
years later that it was finished.</p>

<p>Charles carried to Rome the sacred head, to
offer it for the veneration of the Pope, Boniface
VIII. We are not told how it had come
about, but the head had been discovered deprived
of the lower maxillary. The Pope knew that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
relic of this sort was honoured at the church of
St. John Lateran in connection with St. Mary
Magdalene. It was found to fit perfectly, and
the Pope presented it to the King, who did not
keep it with the greater part of the head, possibly
because the magnificent reliquary would have had
to be altered to receive it, but presented it in his
turn to the nuns of Notre Dame de Nazareth
at Aix. There it remained, until the amiable
King René, who has left such a pleasant memory
of himself in Provence, finally restored it to Saint-Maximin.</p>

<p>During all the two hundred and forty years
that the great church was in the building the
precious relics that it enshrined attracted pilgrims
without number. Six Popes visited them, to say
nothing of two anti-Popes; in one year alone five
kings bowed before the shrine; royalties came from
as far off as Sweden; the unfortunate Albigenses,
after they had "abjured their errors,"
were compelled to make pilgrimage to it; and
finally Louis XIV, with his mother, Anne of
Austria, his brother, afterwards Duke of Orleans,
and a numerous and splendid following, bent his
knee at the sacred tomb, and assisted in the translation
of the relics into a magnificent receptacle
of porphyry. These relics would not, of course,
include the head. Some vertebræ were offered
to the Queen, who accepted them with gratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
The sacred bones were examined by the King's
head physician, and immediately placed in a case
of lead covered with gold brocade, upon which
the King placed his seal in six places. It was
carried the next day in procession, and the church
was filled with people, who shed tears of joy to
see renewed in their own day "a devotion so holy
and august in the presence of a king and queen
so pious and devout."</p>

<p>During all these years, however, the relics had
not been preserved without vicissitude or diminution.
Under the Queen Jeanne, Provence was
overrun by brigands, and for three years they
were hidden at Sainte-Baume. King René gave
part of the lower arm to the nuns who had the
lower jaw. In 1505 a Neapolitan monk robbed
the reliquary of its jewels, and was caught and
hanged. After this mutilation a new reliquary
was presented by the Queen of France, Anne
of Brittany, as splendid as the old one, and a
statuette of herself was added to it in enamelled
gold. Louis XIII asked for some fragments of
the body, and was refused. Four years later he
asked again, on behalf of the Queens Mary of
Medici and Anne of Austria, and was more successful,
obtaining also a fragment to be presented
to the Sovereign Pontiff.</p>

<p>In 1639 a portion of the much venerated <i>noli
me tangere</i> was stolen from the head, and, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
it is the same or not, a minute particle of the
<i>noli me tangere</i> is cherished in the church of Mane,
in the Basses-Alps. In 1781 Louis XVI ordered
a thigh bone to be detached and presented
to the Duke of Parma, which was done.</p>

<p>We have followed the story for nearly eighteen
hundred years, and now comes the Revolution,
which wrought more havoc than all the successive
disturbances that had taken place before it. The
church was spoiled and the sacred relics profaned.
The porphyry urn was violated, and the
documents it contained burnt. The glorious remains
of the saint were thrown pell-mell on the
pavement, the head was torn from its gold case,
and the other bones from their reliquaries. But
the piety of the sacristan preserved the chief glory
of the church, which was restored to it five years
later. The head, a bone from one of the arms,
some locks of hair, together with the reliquary
of the Holy Ampulla, and sundry fragments of
the bodies of other saints were received back when
the storm had passed over, and there the bulk
of them remain to this day.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>The Church of Saint-Maximin</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">So persuasive was M. Rostan that when I had
read his account of all this, sitting in front of
the fire at my inn, within a stone's throw of the
great church that had been the scene of so many
strange and moving happenings, it is small wonder
that I was inclined to believe at least a good
half of it. It was my first introduction to the
legend, which was to colour so much of my future
wanderings, and many of the facts that I have
given were unknown to me then. I thought, at
least, that the main facts vouching for its truth
went much farther back than they seem to, and
if it was difficult to accept quite that galaxy of
New Testament names, or the story of the miraculous
voyage, still I thought there might be some
truth in the tradition as attaching to some of
them.</p>

<p>What emerges as indisputable fact, and what
moved me at the time, is that through some centuries
countless people did believe in every word
of it, and thronged this little town where I was
resting from all parts of the then known world.
And there in the church which I was to see on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the morrow was&mdash;no doubt about this either&mdash;the
very thing that had brought them here&mdash;princes
and prelates, hard soldiers and lawyers, men and
women of every degree, making journeys, some
of them, of immense difficulty just for the sake
of beholding what I or any other traveller coming
into a dull little town could see for a few
sous before passing on our way. Or would not
even take the trouble to see. A man with whom
I had talked at dinner came to Saint-Maximin
several times in the year and had never seen it.
He was '<i>bon Catholique</i>,' too, and said that there
was no doubt at all that it was the head of St.
Mary Magdalene they had in the church there.
Some day he would go and see it, but not to-morrow,
for he was too busy.</p>

<p>You may put your finger on strange gaps in
such a story; you may find the first foundations
upon which it rests too weak to bear it; parts
of it you may refuse altogether to believe. But
make what deductions you wish, and what a lot
remains.</p>

<p><i>Some</i> poor tired body was laid to rest in the
soil from which this great church has sprung at
a time when there were still alive those who had
walked and talked with Our Lord; and it was
the body of one who was venerated. Out of the
dusk of successive centuries come gleams of light
that show innumerable people, who differed not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
so greatly from ourselves, believing that the remains
they had knowledge of were those that
their forbears had held in honour from the beginning.
It becomes hardly more difficult to
believe that they were than that they were
not.</p>

<p>Say that there has been error, say that there
has been fraud if you like, and what have you
denied? Nothing in the way of strong and moving
power over those who have believed. There
is the church, to which men whose names stand
out in history made successive gifts through two
centuries and a half, until it stood the splendid
monument that it is today. There is the dust
that countless pilgrims' feet have trodden for two
centuries past. There is the echo of prayers and
hymns, sighs from burdened hearts and praise
from lightened ones that have gone up through
ages from this place. The Revolution, which was
to sweep away all error and superstition, might
despise these sanctities, and scatter the venerated
human dust, but it could not destroy the least
particle of the faith that had been. It did not
move the iconoclasts, but it had moved the world,
and its effects remain in spite of them.</p>

<p>The wind had blown itself out the next morning
and the air was cold, but sunny and still,
as I paid my early visit to the church.</p>

<p>Its beauty is compelling, and when I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
walked round it I sat down and tried to find
out for myself in what it consists.</p>

<p>The first impression is one of austere simplicity.
There are a nave and two aisles, with chapels,
no transepts, and except for the Renaissance work
about the choir and the altar, and the fine pulpit,
scarcely any decoration. Rows of clustered pillars
carry arches between the nave and the aisles;
and between the arches spring from the floor
itself successive groups of three very slender pillars,
like rods of stone attached to the wall, which
run up uninterrupted far above the arcading,
until from a simple moulding spring the delicate
ribs of the vaulting, all as light as if it were a
roof of leaves held up by slim tree-trunks. The
sense of lightness is wonderful, gained as it is
without the slightest disguise of the solid masonry,
by sculpture or other suggestion; and the wonder
increases when one remembers that this is not
the work of one architectural genius, but the
flower of many successive periods of building.
It is clean and strong and beautiful, a church
with a true religious significance.</p>

<p>The choir contains some very fine wood-carving
and metal-work of the seventeenth century, and
above the gilt and jasper of the high altar is a
rich device of almost life-size angels and cherubs,
surrounding and enclosing a little oval window
on which the Holy Dove is emblazoned. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
morning sun, shining through this window, made
a striking effect, though it is perhaps at variance
with the pure dignity of the church itself. The
celestial figures are wrought with a gay and delightful
luxuriance of imagination. They overflow
from the main composition with its sweep
and spread of angels' wings; delicious cherubic
forms perch on the marble of the reredos, on the
carved frames of the medallions which it encloses,
on the rich screens of the choir itself; and each
of them has its own attitude of devotion, or interest,
or expectation, or even curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The inspiration of the Gothic had begun to die
away when the fabric of the church had come
near to completion. We may perhaps be thankful
that it was never quite finished, for it has
such perfection of life as it stands: life that sprang
from an impulse lasting through centuries. No
such impulse exists now. It is safe to say that
the most understanding and sympathetic architecture
would seem like a dead thing if it were
sought to complete what was left undone.</p>

<p>The church lovers of the Renaissance made no
such mistake. Their work was alive, too, and
they spent their inspiration not on the beautiful
fabric of the church but on its rich furnishing.
What they wrought is as far away from us as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the work of the Gothic builders was from them,
and it is almost as unapproachable.</p>

<p>The iconoclasts of the Revolution wreaked their
devastating zeal upon this Gloria, and upon any
symbol or figure in the rich carvings of the choir
that spoke of power or privilege. The church
itself they spared, though you may see a device
of <i>fleur de lys</i> on a boss of the roof vaulting
spitefully disfigured by bullets.</p>

<p>What was it that they hated so? The arrogance
of a church that had allied itself too much
with the rich and powerful and worked on superstitions
of mankind to gain riches and power and
glory to itself, when there was so much wretchedness
all around that it made small attempts to
cope with? They would have said so, and to
imagine them possessed only by the spirit of
wickedness would be to make the same mistake
about them as they made about the Church. In
that dark hour the Church reaped the reward
of its virtues at the same time as it paid for its
sins. To the extent that it had been faithful those
who had drawn comfort and consolation from
it came to its aid; and if the fury of its attackers
had been ten times as great they could not have
stamped out the life that persisted through all
the years of destruction; and flowered again profusely
when the poor substitutes that had been
planted in its place had wilted away. Religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
could have done everything to heal the wrongs
that had been suffered by the people who were
now rising up to take the redress of wrongs into
their own hands; and religion had done very little.
It had been chiefly on the side of the oppressors,
not of the oppressed. At its best it had given
consolation in trouble that it had not sought to
remove, at its worst it had committed crimes unspeakable.
No wonder that a blind, insensate
fury against the outward tokens of such a system
seized those who thought that they had a mission
to remove all oppression from the world. The
buildings that enshrined it they could put to other
uses, and the churches themselves were spared.
But sacred relics they scattered to the dust with
bitter contempt, and the treasures of art which
spoke of an impotent faith that they despised,
they destroyed or mutilated.</p>

<p>One of the minor glories of Saint-Maximin is
the Altar of the Crucifixion, or the <i>Corpus Domini</i>,
at the end of the north aisle. The high
reredos, with gilded columns and pilasters, frames
two large paintings and a series of sixteen smaller
ones on wood, which are of the utmost interest.
It has only comparatively lately become known
that these are the work of a Venetian painter of
the early sixteenth century, Antonio Ronzen, who
stayed at Saint-Maximin two years and a half to
execute them, together with the reredos itself.</p>

<p class="p1">Though Ronzen came into Provence from Venice,
it seems unlikely that he was an Italian. His
name is Dutch, and so is his style of painting;
and a striking resemblance has been pointed out
between one of these paintings and an engraving
of the same subject executed by Lucas van
Leyden ten years before. Wherever he came
from, Ronzen was a great artist, and left behind
him at Saint-Maximin a great treasure.</p>

<p>The sixteen panels are of different scenes in
the Passion. The light was not good when I was
in the church, and some of them are too high
to be seen easily; but most of them are wonderfully
fresh and vivid and suggestive, crowded with
figures, and creating that sense of intimacy which
has always been the mark of the Dutch school.
Each of the scenes is set in a characteristic landscape.
You can pick out the Ducal Palace at
Venice, the Palace of the Popes at Avignon, the
Coliseum; and the figures include all the types
of the period, from the aristocrat to the peasant.
Many of them, no doubt, are portraits of people
very well known in their time, who came in and
out of the church, or wherever the artist did his
work, to see how he was getting on, and had a
great deal to say about the painting and about the
magnificent present that the Seigneur de Semblançay
was making to the church, and what a
fortunate thing it was that so clever an artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had been available to undertake the commission.
Perhaps they used a little flattery, so that he
should offer to "put them in."</p>

<p>He was an important person, this Jacques de
Beaune, Seigneur de Semblançay. He was superintendent
of the finances of Francis I, whose
finances wanted a good deal of looking after, and
lived at this time chiefly in Paris. But previously
he had been Treasurer-General of Provence, and
it might have been well for him if he had stayed
in his own country. For he fell into disgrace, and
was put to death seven years after Ronzen had
finished the pictures he had ordered from him.
Probably he found time, during the period from
the end of 1517 to July, 1520, when Ronzen was
at Saint-Maximin, to pay him a few visits and
see how he was progressing. According to the
custom of the time his portrait would almost certainly
have been included among the figures that
still appear so lifelike after five hundred years,
and remains there, if we could only tell which
of them all it is. Did he have any premonition
or dread of the fate that was hanging over him,
and did the people who were taking such a lively
interest in the work he was inaugurating think of
him as having attained to the pinnacle of success,
and much to be envied in comparison with themselves,
living humdrum lives in their beautiful
Provence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p class="b1">Saint-Maximin has a fine Sacristy, furnished
with presses and panelling of beautifully carved
walnut, of the seventeenth century. Before the
Revolution it contained many rich treasures, gold
cups and chalices, silver reliquaries, ornaments
jewelled and enamelled. Kings and Sovereign
Pontiffs had showered gifts upon it; but in 1793
everything was rifled.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Barras and Fréron came to carry out the
spoliation. Barras presented himself to the Popular
Assembly to announce his mission, and a
simple peasant, Jean Saurin, who died in 1842,
Member of the Club, alone rose before the representative
of the Convention to protest against the
act of vandalism. He spoke honourably and with
energy, but without success: the church was despoiled.
Some rare and precious fragments, however,
were saved from the wreck by the care and
devotion of the sub-sacristan, Joseph Bastide,
whose name deserves to be held in grateful memory
by archæologists; for besides the sacred bones
that the Church of Saint-Maximin can still offer,
thanks to him, to public veneration, he was able
to withdraw from the revolutionary spoliation a
few rich ornaments, some ancient reliquaries, and
a textile specimen of great value, the cope of
St. Louis d'Anjou, Bishop of Toulouse. This
cope, of the end of the thirteenth century, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by the holy bishop to the convent founded by his
father, is one of the most beautiful and curious
ornaments of the period."</p>

<p class="p1">Thus M. Rostan, who proceeds to describe it.
But alas! it is no longer there. The sacristan,
worthy descendant of the pious Joseph Bastide,
told me the sad story after he had made me admire
the beautiful woodwork and shown me how
the long drawers in the presses that held the
vestments drew in and out, as if they had been
made yesterday instead of two hundred and fifty
years ago.</p>

<p>He had taken such care of the treasures under
his charge, locking up everything whenever he
left the church, and seeing that all was fast when
he went home for the night. And often he
would look out of his window, in the little ancient
house in which he lived hard by, to satisfy himself
that no marauders were about.</p>

<p>But ten years ago&mdash;how well he remembered
it&mdash;the marauders had come. He pointed to the
iron-barred window through which they had made
their entry. They had taken I forget what from
the sacristy, but not the precious cope. I think
he rather wished they had. Then they had broken
into the church and into the crypt, and from
there they had stolen the Holy Ampulla.</p>

<p>"This name is given," wrote M. Rostan, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
years before the theft, "to a tube of crystal
bearing the characters of the fourteenth century,
and containing little fragments of glass, the remains
of a phial still more ancient, which enclosed,
according to tradition, some of the precious blood
of the Saviour, collected by St. Mary Magdalene
on Mount Calvary, brought by her to our country
and discovered with the remains of this illustrious
penitent."</p>

<p>The thieves had broken into the iron-protected
case in which this relic was kept, together with
the skull of the saint in its rich and heavy
reliquary, and a bone from the arm. They had
stolen the bone, too, but had left the chief treasure
intact, possibly because it was too heavy and bulky
to bear away with safety.</p>

<p>What was the meaning of this strange crime?
As far as I understand what happened, the breaking
in was difficult, and nothing of great intrinsic
value was taken, though many things might have
been. Much money, certainly, would be paid for
such relics as were stolen, if they could have
been bought openly; but if the fact that they had
been stolen would have to be disclosed, as it would
in order to attach even a damaged authenticity
to them, of what value were they to anybody?</p>

<p>Protestant zeal, which sometimes indulges itself
in a similar way in England, may be ruled out.
In France it does not act with those impulsions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and in any case destruction or contemptuous mutilation
would be its object rather than theft, and
I think the people who had done the damage
would be rather inclined to advertise it, and themselves.
The sacred skull was not damaged.</p>

<p>Is it not forced upon one to believe that their
value to the thief, or to those who may have encouraged
the theft, was precisely that which they
had always had; which was not represented by
money at all?</p>

<p>"If our tradition is well-founded," wrote M.
Rostan, "the <i>Sainte Ampoule</i> is evidently the
most precious relic of the Church of Saint-Maximin.
It has enjoyed wide celebrity throughout
centuries, and frequent miracles have been attributed
to it. On Good Friday, after the reading
of the Passion, the traces of the divine blood
were seen to liquefy, to rise and fall, bubbling,
and to fill the whole phial. It was called the 'holy
miracle.' A great crowd of pilgrims came each
year to witness it."</p>

<p>Where is the relic hidden now? Does the thief
who risked so much to possess it cherish it in
secret, with his sin on his conscience, but hoping
from its possession one knows not what in the
way of preservation or blessing? Or is it hidden
fearfully in some church&mdash;a priceless treasure
that may never be displayed, but may be expected,
by its secret presence, to sanctify its resting-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
above other places? Do those who hold it still
watch with strained attention on Good Fridays
for the "holy miracle" to be performed? Do
they perhaps persuade themselves that they see
it, as many others must have done before them?
For even M. Rostan, good and believing Catholic
that he is, does not assert that the liquefaction
has been plain to see within living memory.</p>

<p>I asked the sacristan whether the theft had
been held to be the work of religious enthusiasts,
but either he misunderstood me or his grievance
overshadowed all such questions.</p>

<p>They had taken the wonderful cope out of
his care. It was a unique specimen of thirteenth
century needlework, and is now in safe keeping
in Paris. After so many years they might have
trusted him to look after it, he said, ignoring
the fact that his care had proved unequal to the
preservation of relics still more valuable, at least
in the eyes of the Church. The Ministry of Fine
Arts, or whatever authority had deprived Saint-Maximin
of the cope, had been quite content that
it should keep the sacred skull, showing some
cynicism, it may be thought, as well as indulgence.</p>

<p>With much unlocking of iron grilles and doors,
we descended into the crypt, the storied place that
has seen so much during centuries past, where
kings and popes have bent the knee, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
which so many princes and nobles have put off
their arms.</p>

<p>It is almost square&mdash;a vaulted chamber about
fourteen feet wide and a little longer, with an
apse containing the altar, behind which is the
reliquary enclosing the skull. The staircase leading
down to it, and the side walls of the crypt
itself, have been decorated with marble, comparatively
recently, but the form of the chamber remains
much as it always has been.</p>

<p>The sacred tombs, heavily carved with Biblical
subjects, in the manner of the fourth century,
are ranged on either side. They are said to be
those of St. Maximin, St. Marcelle, St. Susan,
St. Sidonius, and St. Mary Magdalene herself.
They have been a good deal mutilated "by the
piety of pilgrims," and in some degree made up,
for the covers do not always belong to the sarcophagi
on which they are fixed, or indeed to any other here.</p>

<p>The head of the Magdalen is contained in an
elaborate gilt reliquary of the year 1860, of small
artistic value. Under a heavy canopy four angels
hold up a hollow metal bust with flowing hair,
into which the head has been fitted.</p>

<p>What can one say of it? The sacristan pointed
out to me the <i>noli me tangere</i> on the forehead,
and I tried hard but could not distinguish it,
though he said that it was quite plain to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
He was a believer, and I, frankly, was not,
although the great antiquity of the relic and its
stirring history aroused at least an endeavour to
put myself in the mood of one who believed. But
he, the believer, made it all appear so commonplace,
holding up his stump of a candle here and
there to exhibit a great curiosity, but showing
no sign either in manner or speech of being moved
to veneration or awe, or to any feeling outside
those attaching to his customary occupation, that
it is little wonder that I was scarcely able to produce
any emotion at all.</p>

<p>One asks oneself many questions. Are not all
the signs and wonders wrought by such relics as
these a matter of self-deception, induced by crowds
and movement and the atmosphere of enthusiasm?
Or, in the rare instances in which they have been
experienced by one alone, arising out of some
state of ecstasy, hardly to be accepted as convincing
testimony? If not, then how vaguely
and arbitrarily these occult powers work! Faced
by a known, even if half understood, power of
nature, one knows the power to be there, and it
will be felt beyond question if contact is made
with it. Here, with a supposed spiritual power,
there is only deadness of spirit, even with those
who have the faith.</p>

<p>With one's facile modern venerations one is
inclined to shudder at the iconoclasm of the Revolutionists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
who laid rude hands on such objects
as this. But may they not have been right after
all? Long periods of deadness of spirit are a
heavy price to pay for an occasional and questionable
exhibition of arbitrary activity. And
there are spiritual powers that do react to an
exercise of faith, neither occasionally nor questionably,
nor arbitrarily, which belief in tangible
sanctities tends to obscure.</p>

<p>We locked and barred the grilles and doors
and came up into the sunlight, leaving the much
venerated relic to keep its watch in the dark crypt.
With whatever lack of emotion it may be faced
now, even by a believer, there has been no lack
of it in the long past. And whatever view you
may take of it, it is the seed from which sprang
this strong and beautiful church.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Caius Marius and the Great Battle</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">It was still early when I had finished with these
sights and took the long straight road to Trets
on my way to Aix. The sky was very clear and
cold, and the country was flat and open. For
a long time, whenever I looked back, I could
see the great church standing up across the plain,
and it was a long time before I ceased thinking
about it.</p>

<p>But gradually another interest began to take
its place, for I was passing through country
where scenes had been enacted that changed the
current of history long before the legend of which
my mind had been full had had its beginning.
Indeed, centuries were to elapse before the legend
was to emerge out of the twilight of rumour and
tradition and to rest upon documentary evidence,
and yet the one story seems to go back to the
dim ages of history while the other far earlier
one is as plain in its main facts as if it were of
yesterday. For it is of the Roman occupation
of this country, and our feet are on the solid rock
of history.</p>

<p>After two thousand years, the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
great deliverer, Caius Marius, is still alive in
Provence. Twice alive, indeed, if the very legend
of the Marys which permeates the country can
be traced back to the tradition of the Marii, of
which there seems little doubt. But to that we
shall come when we visit Les Baux and the monuments
there.</p>

<p>In the year 102 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Caius Marius gained a
great victory over the Ambrons and Teutons at
a spot between Saint-Maximin and Trets which
I was to pass that morning. It was one of the
decisive battles of the world, and to judge by
the number of the slain one of the fiercest. You
may read all about it in Plutarch, and here on
the very spot you may follow the details of the
parallel march of the Romans and the barbarians
until they came to the place of the great slaughter,
with recognition at every step, finding indeed here
and there actual traces of the battle itself. Certain
doubtful points have been cleared up and
the story told by the Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould,
who went over the whole ground, Plutarch in
hand, and published his results in a chapter of
his interesting book, "In Troubadour Land."</p>

<p>In the year 113 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> the northern frontiers of
Italy were threatened by a vast horde of barbarians,
of whom the chief were the Cimbri and
the Teutons. They did not, however, cross the
Alps, but swept westwards into Gaul, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
with them other tribes, among whom were the
Ambrons.</p>

<p>They reached the Rhône three years afterwards
and defeated the governor of the Roman province.
Three successive consuls were sent against them
from Rome, and were also defeated. Their chiefs
exalted by success consulted as to whether they
should march into Italy and exterminate or enslave
the Romans, but although they devastated
the province they could not yet make up their
minds to march upon Rome.</p>

<p>The Cimbri divided from the rest and poured
into Spain, which they ravaged. A few years
later they returned, and it was now decided to
invade Italy. The Cimbri were to enter it by
way of the Brenner Pass, the Teutons and Ambrons
by the Maritime Alps.</p>

<p>The menace of the barbarians had been hanging
over Rome for ten years, and the utmost
consternation now prevailed. Marius was despatched
into Provence, as the only man who could
cope with the danger there. The barbarian horde
had not yet reached the Rhône on their eastward
march, but were moving slowly in that direction,
and Marius had a winter in which to organize the
demoralized Roman troops and to choose his
positions.</p>

<p>In the spring, when the grass had grown enough
to provide food for their horses and oxen, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
barbarians put themselves in motion. Marius left
the Cimbri to take their agreed-upon route to the
north-east, and waited for the Teutons and Ambrons.
He allowed them to cross the Rhône, and
they drew up before his fortified camp at St.
Gabriel on the westernmost spur of the Alpilles,
and shouted defiance and insult to his troops. But
he restrained the Romans from attacking them.
Their ambition, he told them, should not now be
for triumphs and trophies but to dispel the dreadful
storm that hung over them and to save Italy
itself from destruction.</p>

<p>The barbarians made a half-hearted attack
upon the Roman camp, which was easily repulsed,
and then moved on. It was said that though
they moved forward without pause it took them
six days to pass the camp, so vast were their
numbers. They were indeed nations and not only
armies on the march. The cumbrous house-wagons
with which they moved were their homes, for their
wives and families were with them, and none had
been left behind.</p>

<p>The hot-blooded Romans were by now inured
to their insults, one of which was to shout the
question whether they had any commands for
their wives in Italy, for they would shortly be
with them. One can picture them sulkily watching
from the high ground, where they were encamped,
the interminable rabble moving on day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
after day, and wondering whether they would
ever end. But directly the barbarians had passed
Marius struck camp and followed them, not by
the straight Roman road which they had taken
along the valley, but by the heights to the south,
and observed all their movements, himself out of
sight.</p>

<p>At Aix the Ambrons detached themselves from
their allies to make a descent upon Marseilles.
Marius had fixed upon a hill for his camp at
Les Milles, four miles to the south of Aix. It
was unexceptionable in point of strength, but
afforded little water. By this circumstance, says
Plutarch, they tell us he wanted to excite his
soldiers to action, and when many of them complained
of thirst he pointed to the river Arc,
which ran close by the enemy's camp, and told
them that thence they must buy water with their
blood.</p>

<p>It was this lack of water that precipitated the
contest. The soldiers obeyed the order first of
all to fortify their camp, but the servants of the
army could not be restrained from going down
to the river for water. Some of the enemy were
bathing in the hot springs that well up in this
place, others were eating. These were cut off by
the camp-followers, others came to their assistance,
and the Roman soldiers rushed down from
the hill to rescue their servants. The engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
became general, and the Ambrons were
beaten with great loss, the river being choked with
their dead.</p>

<p>This was a good beginning, but the Romans
spent the night in fear of attack, for their camp
was not yet fortified. "There remained yet many
myriads of the barbarians unconquered; and such
of the Ambrons as escaped mixing with them, a
cry was heard all night not like the sighs and
groans of men, but like the howling and bellowing
of wild beasts. As this came from such an
innumerable host the neighbouring mountains and
the hollow banks of the river returned the sound,
and the horrid din filled all the plains. The Romans
felt a sense of terror, and Marius himself
was filled with apprehension at the idea of a
tumultuous night engagement."</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the barbarians did not
attack, but after a day and a night moved on
and joined the Teutons, who were passing along
the road to the north of the river Arc. At this
point Plutarch's narrative becomes confused, for
he does not effectually distinguish the fields of
the two battles, which were fought two days apart.
It is here that Mr. Baring-Gould's careful investigations
are valuable in elucidating the narrative.</p>

<p>The barbarians halted at the Roman station
Tegulata, now the hamlet of La Petite Pugère,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a day's march from Aix. Marius crossed the
river and kept to the south of it till he reached
Trets. At his rear he had a fortified camp on
Mount Olympus, to the north of the barbarians
was another fortified Roman camp, Panis Annonæ,
still called Pain de Munition. To this
he had sent the day before an officer with three
thousand men, who had made their way to it
protected by the range of Mont Victoire. His
plan must have been made long before, from a
careful consideration of the route the enemy was
likely to take, and the commanding positions fortified
and provisioned. The barbarians were in a
trap, but did not yet know it.</p>

<p>In the morning the enemy awoke to see the
bulk of the Roman army drawn up on the slope
of a hill to the south of their camp. They could
not contain their impatience until the army advanced
into the plain, and received their first setback
by rushing up to attack it. Marius sent his
officers among the troops with orders to stand still
and await the onslaught. When the enemy was
within reach they were to throw their javelins, and
then, sword in hand, press them down with their
shields. He knew that the slope was so slippery
that the blows of the enemy would be delivered
with no great force and that they could not keep
any close order.</p>

<p>When this attack had been repulsed the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
crossed the river and fell upon the main
body of the enemy, who was beginning to form
again. But at the same time the ambushed troops
descended from Panis Annonæ in the rear, and
panic seized the barbarians. The slaughter was
terrific. Plutarch gives the number of killed as
a hundred thousand of the enemy alone. Some
accounts double the number, and give that of the
prisoners as another eighty thousand. It is said
also that three hundred thousand of the camp-followers
and women were either killed or sold
into slavery. It was the extermination not of an
army but of a nation.</p>

<p class="b1">So frightful was the carnage that the field of
battle was known as Campi Putridi, and the neighbouring
village is still called Pourrières. It was
said that the inhabitants of Marseilles walled in
their vineyards with the bones they found in the
field, and that the rain which fell the winter
following soaked in the moisture of the putrefied
bodies and the ground was so enriched by it that
it bore a prodigious crop.</p>

<p class="pbq">"After the battle, Marius selected from among
the arms and other spoils such as were elegant
and entire, and likely to make the greatest show
in his triumph. The rest he piled together, and
offered as a splendid sacrifice to the gods. The
army stood round the pile, crowned with laurel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and himself, arrayed in his purple robe, and girt
after the manner of the Romans, took a lighted
torch. He had just lifted it up with both hands
towards heaven, and was about to set fire to the
pile, when some friends were seen galloping towards
him. Great silence and expectation followed.
When they were come near, they leaped
from their horses and saluted Marius as consul
for the fifth time, delivering him letters to the
same purpose. This added great joy to the
solemnity, which the soldiers expressed by acclamations
and by clanking their arms; and while
the officers were presenting Marius with new
crowns of laurel, he set fire to the pile and finished
the sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p class="p1">How different from the sort of corroboration
brought to bear upon the later Christian history
of Provence is the fact that the spot on which this
great holocaust took place two thousand years
ago has lately been identified by the ashes, melted
lead and other metals, and fragments of burnt
pottery discovered there!</p>

<p>Here also was erected a monument to Marius,
which existed in its entirety up to the time of
the Revolution, and was then partially destroyed,
one would like to know why. And here was found
some five and twenty years ago a beautiful Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
marble statue of Venus Victrix, but without head
and arms, which is now in the museum at Avignon.
Mr. Baring-Gould considers that this proves that
the monument was raised by Julius Cæsar, for
there would be an indirect compliment to his own
family in it. "Venus was the ancestress of the
Julian race, and Cæsar perhaps insinuated, if he
erected the statue, that the success of Marius was
due to the patronage of the divine ancestress and
protectress of the Julian race, and of Julius
Cæsar's aunt, the wife of Marius, quite as
much as to the genius in war of Marius himself."</p>

<p>On the top of Mount Victoire, which overlooks
the scene of the terrific battle, a temple
was erected and dedicated to Venus Victrix. This
became a Christian church, and Venus Victrix
became St. Victoire. Right up to the time of
the Revolution the inhabitants of the neighbouring
villages ascended the mountain on March 23rd,
bearing boughs of box and shouting "Victoire!
Victoire!" and Mass was celebrated. Then a
bonfire was lit, and the peasants with garlands
on their heads danced the farandole round it.
The beautiful ancient music to which the peasants
made their progress is still preserved; so hard does
tradition die in this land of long memories.</p>

<p>I should have liked to make a stay at Trets,
and to explore this country. There is so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to see in connection with the battle&mdash;the ruins
of the church on Mont Victoire, the ruins of the
trophy on the field itself, the traces of the fortifications
on the Pain de Munition, and perhaps
the very hill slope of slippery marl upon which
the Romans first bore back the attacking enemy.
But I wanted to get on to Aix, the first large
Provençal city in my itinerary, and thence to
Arles and Nîmes and the rest of the beautiful
places that are like a cluster of jewels in the
country's diadem. So I contented myself with
identifying the mountain heights which played
their part in that grim struggle twenty centuries
ago.</p>

<p>There was the great range running parallel
to the road on the south, with Mount Aurelian
rising up and overlooking Saint-Maximin, and
Mount Olympus due south from the field of
battle. There was the bold rampart of Mont
Victoire away to the north, and the hills among
which is the Pain de Munition, on the other side
of the plain on which the battle was fought. I
could picture it alive with the tents and wagons
of the vast horde of barbarians, so soon to be
exterminated, and then strewn with their dead
or mangled bodies. I knew that I was looking
upon the same everlasting hills as those thousands
upon thousands of dying eyes looked upon centuries
ago; and there was more of a thrill in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
than in the sight of the blackened skull in the
church of Saint-Maximin.</p>

<p>For this mighty conflict happened here, without
a doubt, and the plain and the hills upon
which our eyes look today were a part of the
happening. There is something for the imagination
to rest and work upon.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Aix</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">The rain began to fall as I sat outside the inn
at Porcieux, and by the time I reached Trets I
was wet through. So I went to bed in an inn
until my clothes should be dry, and greatly daring
ordered a cup of tea. When it came it was
of a pale straw colour, and its flavour would not
have satisfied the connoisseurs of Mincing Lane.
But it was tea, with the astringent quality possessed
by that beverage alone among all infusions
of herbs or berries. Wine is one of the gifts
of God that in this drab world one may be thankful
for, but as a beverage it palls. Of all the
many drinks I enjoyed in my travels in Provence
I think that cup of indifferent tea stands
out as the most refreshing.</p>

<p>My clothes were brought up to me in an hour
or two's time almost as wet as ever, and I put
them on and went down into the kitchen to dry
them myself. There was an enormous open
hearth, but very little fire on it; but they threw
on bundles of sticks, and very soon there was a
hot fire. The master of the inn, his wife and
daughters, the cook in his white cap and apron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
who had just come in to begin his evening's work,
and one or two maids, all took the most serious
and sympathetic interest in the process. I hung
my coat on the back of a chair, which I placed
on the hearth itself, and stood by the fire, turning
to it first one side and then the other, enveloped
in a cloud of steam from my sopping
flannel trousers. I should have thought that most
people under the necessity of drying their clothes
would have done so something after this fashion,
but to them it seemed to show an ingenious originality,
and people were summoned from tables
in the <i>café</i> to stand at the kitchen door and see
the remarkable sight. When I was fairly dry
we all drank wine together, after which we shook
hands and I went out to see the town, leaving
behind me, by all tokens, an agreeable
memory.</p>

<p>Trets is very old, and has the appearance of
being uncared for. One is so accustomed, in
France, to seeing remains of historic interest
cleaned and furbished up and saved from further
decay, that these ruinous gateways and towers
and fortifications, and narrow untidy streets with
decayed-looking houses lining them, strike a dismal
note. The church is partly of the eleventh
century, very massive and very dark inside, and
has an unfinished tower that adds to the general
appearance of decay. Perhaps the rain, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had begun to fall again, had something to do
with the impression that the place made upon
me; I was glad enough to get away from it and
take the train to Aix.</p>

<p>I dined for a franc at Gardanne, and reached
Aix after dark in renewed torrents of rain. But
I had something to look forward to&mdash;an hotel
that I knew, which would provide a hot bath, and
a bag of clothes waiting for me. I had been on
the road for nine days, and was ready for a little
ordinary comfort.</p>

<p>It was dull and cold the next morning, and
Aix is a city that has provided itself against heat.
Its fine broad central boulevard, the Cours Mirabeau,
is shaded by a double avenue of planes,
which must be among the largest to be found
even in this land of planes. The Place de la
Rotonde, at one end of it, has an elaborate system
of fountains, and there are three other fountains
in the middle of the boulevard itself, one
of which is fed by a hot spring. The shade of
the giant trees and the plash of the water must
be pleasant enough in hot weather, but the bare
branches conveyed none of the charm that their
foliage would give later on, and Aix seemed to
me a little cheerless, though I hasten to say that
that is not its true character.</p>

<p>Aix rejoices in the name of "The French
Athens." It has always been learned, classical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and aristocratic. The streets are lined with the
fine hotels of the Provençal <i>noblesse</i>, some of
which are still occupied by families whose roots
strike far back into history. Many of them are
said to contain rare treasures of art, hidden from
the public gaze in proud seclusion, and for the
most part unknown to the world.</p>

<p class="b1">These things are not for the wayfarer to see,
but I think that if I had read M. Paul Mariéton's
charming book, "La Terre Provençal," before my
walk in Provence instead of after, I should have
made an attempt to see some of them.</p>

<p class="pbq">"In Aix," he writes, "you will find masterpieces
in rooms scarcely furnished, mansions
mouldering to decay, with staircases of honour
bare and cold leading to garden courts uncultivated&mdash;unless
a few vegetables for the pot are
grown between staves in wine casks.</p>

<p class="pbq">"An undoubted masterpiece, in a mansion
neither cold nor bare, but full of laughter and
gaiety, is the portrait of Rubens by Vandyke,
which the master presented to his friend Peiresc
at Antwerp. The existence of this page of genius,
the most significant, it seems to me, of the great
painter's work, is not suspected by the critics,
and scarcely known except to a few amateurs."</p>

<p class="p1">In another vast Louis XIV hotel, M. Mariéton
mentions a Teniers, two Van Eycks, a Vanloo, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Hobbema, and a Raphael; in another, a superb
ivory Christ attributed to Cellini. And he
speaks of the store of historic documents, still
unpublished, to be found in these ancient
houses.</p>

<p>A wandering Englishman might possibly receive
a welcome in some of these houses because
of his nationality. Aix used to be a favourite
place of residence for English people of rank and
wealth. In the cathedral is a memorial tablet
which I find inscribed in a guide-book as that of
the wife of "sir Dolben, baronnet d'Angleterre,"
and of his three children, who died, the first aged
seven years, the second seven days, and the third
seven hours; and there is another to "sir Webb,
baronnet anglais."</p>

<p>M. Louis de Laincel wrote thirty years ago of
his childhood's memories of a very rich Englishwoman,
"my lady Russel."</p>

<p>"This lady had the generous habit of sending
magnificent presents to all the children of her
acquaintance on New Year's Day. Dieu! what
joy for the children, when the lackey of mylady
Russel rang at the door of the house, carrying on
his arm an enormous basket full of presents!
What bonbons, and what delightful toys! Bonne
lady!"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>This was in the twenties and thirties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
nineteenth century, but it is quite likely that in
this country of long memories the tradition of
English generosity still remains.</p>

<p>But there is plenty to see in Aix without invading
privacies. The city itself I found not
very attractive, partly for the reasons I have
already given. But it is lacking in the pleasant
public gardens which make so many French towns
places of grateful memory: there is only one,
rather small and uninteresting, on the outskirts.
Perhaps it was the society of Aix that attracted
our forbears; otherwise one would have expected
them to prefer Avignon, or Nîmes or Arles, of
the inland cities of southern France.</p>

<p>The large church of St. Madeleine is of the
early eighteenth century, with a rather clumsy imitation
Renaissance façade of the year 1860. It
faces the Place des Prêcheurs, which opens out
into the larger Place du Palais, on the west side
of which is the fine Palais de Justice, and behind
it the heavy ancient prison. A busy market was
going on in this open space, and people were
crowding in and out of the church for the Thursday's
Mass.</p>

<p>It was being sung at a side altar. From the
stacks of chairs by the west door those who entered
would take one, slipping the necessary <i>sous</i>
into the hand of the old woman in charge of them,
and put it down in the most convenient place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
available within view of the ceremony. The organist
sat at a harmonium to the left of the altar,
with his choir boys about him and the congregation
almost jostling his elbows. There was a sort
of domesticity about the scene. One felt that
all the people who came into the church so busily
and familiarly thought of it as a place in which
to make themselves at home.</p>

<p>There was no such air about the fine cathedral
church of St. Saviour. It gave the impression,
more than any French church I have visited, that
one gets in an English cathedral: of a noble
monument of the past, kept in apple-pie order,
but with its religious usages somewhat subordinated
to its historic interest. At St. Madeleine,
the little votive tablets and pictures and relics that
pious souls have brought to their favourite altars
for years past are stuck all over the walls of
the chapels in great profusion, and with no particular
regard to order. The cathedral is not
without them, but they are confined severely to
the neat oval tablet with a gilt frame and gold
lettering on a blue or red ground, and they are
disposed upon the walls or over the arches in
austere devices. And there is none of the tawdriness
about the altars that belongs to churches in
which people make themselves at home. Indeed,
the high altar, and the choir, might belong to a
stately Anglican cathedral, with which the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
people have about as much to do as with
the furnishing of the Deanery.</p>

<p>This cathedral church of St. Saviour is full of
happy surprises. Its component parts have been
built in widely different periods, but it has "come
together" in the most satisfactory way, and its
variety is only equalled by its beauty. The first
surprise, upon entrance, is the magnificent octagonal
Baptistery. It is said to have been originally
a Temple of Apollo, and the eight monolithic
columns that support the modern cupola
are of the Roman period. Two are of granite,
and the rest of porphyry, but the bases and the
delicately carved capitals are of white marble.
The effect of the whole structure is exquisite; it
can be seen from different parts of the cathedral
through intervening arches, and adds enormously
to the charm of the building.</p>

<p>The Baptistery is to the south of the aisle that
was the original church. This aisle was consecrated
in 1103. The present nave, with the
choir slightly out of axis, and the north aisle,
were begun at the end of the thirteenth century
and not finished until the sixteenth. The central
nave is enclosed by walls almost entirely solid,
and the effect of the narrow openings cut through
them, with glimpses into the side aisles, is singularly
pleasing.</p>

<p>The long rows of carved stalls on either side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the choir are surmounted by some very fine
tapestries. The design is attributed to Quentin
Matsy's, and although the guide-books call them
the "Cantorbéry" tapestry, they state that they
came from our St. Paul's Cathedral and were
bought in Paris in the year 1656 for twelve hundred
crowns. But Dr. Montagu Rhodes James,
Provost of King's College,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> investigated the whole
question some years ago, and read a paper before
the Cambridge Antiquarian Society, from which
it appears that there is no foundation for the connection
with St. Paul's. Nor does he say anything
about Quentin Matsy's, though the tapestries
are undoubtedly Flemish, and of his
date.</p>

<p>In the Inventory of Christchurch, Canterbury,
taken in 1540, after the suppression of the monastery,
is the entry "Item one faire new hanging
of riche tapestrie con(taining) vj peces of the
story of Christ and our Lady." Three of them
were the gift of a prior, Thomas Goldston, whose
device appears in the border, and three of Richard
Dering, cellarer; and on the border is part
of an inscription, of which the beginning is lost:
<i>celarius me fieri fecit anno domini millesimo quingentesimo
undecimo</i>; ... the cellarer had me
made <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1511.</p>

<p>So there is no doubt about it. These fine tapestries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hung in the choir of Canterbury Cathedral
for at least a hundred and thirty years, and then
they were sold and taken to Aix, where part of
them hang in the choir and part in the Archbishop's
Palace. They have been a good deal
cut about, and Dr. James thinks there must originally
have been five scenes to a piece, which would
give thirty instead of the twenty-six now to be
seen.</p>

<p>Katharine of Aragon is said, but not by Dr.
James, to be represented among the figures in
the "Descent from the Cross," and there is a
whole bevy of fair Englishwomen in the first
panel of all, which represents "The Birth of
the Virgin." They are portraits of ladies of
the English court, and might be beautiful
English girls of today, so lifelike and characteristic
are they; some of them with the sweetest
young faces of a type that is as well known
now as it apparently was four hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>I tried to get photographs of at least some of
this delightful work in Aix, but without success.
There are postcards of the whole series, but they
are evidently from drawings and not photographs
of the original. In that charming picture of the
English girls the faces lose most of their character
and half their beauty. Let nobody who
may happen to receive one of these postcards
imagine that it gives a satisfactory reproduction
of the original.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Behind the high altar is the Chapel of St.
Mitre. The life of this saint is pictured in many
of its episodes in a curious painting of the sixteenth
century which is to be seen there. His
end was remarkable. He was beheaded but rose
to his feet, picked up his head, and carried it
more than a thousand paces to this very spot.
You may see him approaching the cathedral, his
head in his hands, and the bishop with his attendant
clergy waiting for him at the door. And
in the centre of the composition he is represented,
still with his head in his hands, with many people
on their knees around him, including the whole
family of the pious Jacques de la Roque, who
did not happen to have been present at the time,
but who gave the picture.</p>

<p>St. Mitre's tomb is upheld by two columns of
soft stone, from which is said to exude moisture
that cures blindness. There is a little hole in the
right hand pillar in which the sweating is supposed
to show itself, and during the octave of the
saint many people come to do him honour and
to anoint their eyes from the pillar.</p>

<p>In the Chapelle de l'Université in the north
aisle is a moving representation of St. Martha and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Dragon, the famous "Tarasque," from which
she freed the stricken country. The bull's head
of this curious monster wears an expression of
mildness and mournful surprise, as if it is wondering
what it has done to make itself so disliked.
It seems to be saying: "I was made like
this; I can't help it; I have only followed the dictates
of my nature." The tradition of the Tarasque
is all over Provence, and as most of the
early Christian legends are based upon Roman
happenings it is probable that the dragon stands
for the scourge of invasion by the barbarians,
and the various rescuing saints for Marius and
his Romans.</p>

<p>The triptych, called "Le Buisson Ardent,"
famous since it was exhibited in the great exhibition
of "Primtifs" in the Louvre, in 1904, hangs
on a wall of the nave. It is kept closed, but a
few <i>centimes</i> will unlock it, and also uncover the
beautiful carving of the west doors.</p>

<p>This very fine picture is by Nicolas Froment,
a fifteenth century painter from Avignon. It
has been attributed to King René, but skilful as
that versatile amateur was he could never have
painted anything half so beautiful. The central
picture, with its exquisite and wonderfully preserved
gold border, represents the Virgin and
the Holy Child seated upon a great mass of foliage,
from which spring little flickering flames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Beneath them is an angel appearing to Moses,
who is struck with astonishment and is taking off
his shoe. A flock of sheep and goats is pasturing
between them, and Moses's dog, resting at his
feet, turns his head to the angel with a look
of interest and watchfulness. Behind is a rich
Provençal landscape, with the Rhône running
through it. It is a delicious picture, both in design
and colouring.</p>

<p>The side panels contain portraits of King René,
and of his second wife, Jeanne de Laval, kneeling&mdash;a
panel to each. Above the king stand
Saints Madeleine, Antoine, and Maurice, above
the queen Saints Nicolas, Catharine and John,
all of them evidently contemporary portraits.
The old king, whose many trials and happy disposition,
as well as his love for Provence, have
preserved his memory as that of few kings has
been preserved, is shown to us here as realistically
as if we could look in on him in the flesh. It
is a serious moment with him, and his mouth is
set tightly above the jutting double chin. But
it is not the seriousness of austerity. When he
rises from his knees his face will break out into
smiles, and he will have much to say about the
details of the ceremony at which he has just
assisted. For he was well versed in such matters,
and a patron of all the arts besides.</p>

<p class="b1">He was like a monarch out or a book, this good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
King René; and he has been put into at least one
famous book, though not without a touch of
caricature. In "Anne of Geierstein," Sir Walter
Scott describes him thus:</p>

<p class="pbq">"René was a prince of very moderate parts,
endowed with a love of the fine arts, which he
carried to extremity, and with a degree of good
humour, which never permitted him to repine
at fortune, but rendered its possessor happy, when
a prince of keener feelings would have died of
despair. This <i>insouciant</i>, light-tempered, gay
and thoughtless disposition conducted René, free
from all the passions which embitter life, to a
hale and mirthful old age. Even domestic losses
made no deep impression on the feelings of this
cheerful old monarch. Most of his children had
died young; René took it not to heart. His
daughter Margaret's marriage with the powerful
Henry (VI) of England was considered a connection
above the fortunes of the King of the
Troubadours. But in the issue, instead of René
deriving any splendour from the match, he was
involved in the misfortunes of his daughter, and
repeatedly obliged to impoverish himself to supply
her ransom.... Among all his distresses, René
feasted and received guests, danced, sang, composed
poetry, used the pencil or brush with
no small skill, devised and conducted festivals
and processions, studied to promote the mirth
and good humour of his subjects."</p>

<p class="p1">Of his genuine skill with the brush there is a
most pleasing example preserved in the Bibliothèque
Méjane at Aix&mdash;a Book of Hours, of
which the initial letters are beautifully illuminated
by his hand. There is also a patent of nobility
signed by him in a bold and picturesque
manner. Whether the illuminations are authentic
or not&mdash;and I have no reason to throw doubt
upon them&mdash;René could sign his name, like a
king and an artist.</p>

<p>At the end of the Cours Mirabeau is a large
statue of this merry monarch, of no great artistic
value, but showing him holding in his hand a
bunch of Muscat grapes, which he first introduced
into Europe. It is not his least claim to memory.</p>

<p>We have not quite done with the cathedral.
The wonderful carving of the west doors is protected
by wooden covers, which have kept them
in a perfect state of preservation. They are of
walnut wood, and were done in 1504, seven years
before Richard Dering, the Canterbury cellarer,
gave that commission for the tapestries which now
hang near them. In the lower parts are figures
of Ezekiel, Daniel, Isaiah and Jeremiah, each
under a rich canopy; and above them are the
twelve Sibyls, each of a different nation and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
appropriate symbol. The borders of fruit and
flowers are exquisite. There is hardly a finer
piece of wood-carving on a large scale to be
seen anywhere than on these massive doors, and
they and the triptych should on no account be
missed by any one who finds himself in the
cathedral.</p>

<p>The portal that enshrines these beautiful doors
is of the same date, and is quite worthy of them.
There is a charming figure of the Virgin and
Child on a pedestal between the doors. The lusty,
well-grown baby is held upon his mother's arm,
and she looks at him with smiling pride, as mothers
do all the world over.</p>

<p>The cloisters should also be visited, for the
sake of the carvings on the double rows of pillars
that hold up the arcading, in which the sculptors
have let themselves loose in all sorts of luxuriant
fancies. They are hardly less interesting than
those in the famous cloisters of St. Trophime at
Arles.</p>

<p>Aix is rich in pictures, besides those in the
churches. I spent a pleasant rainy afternoon in
the Museum, and found a great deal to interest
me. Not to mention the very fine examples of
the "Primitives," there are several pictures by
Ingres, including the richly coloured "Jupiter
and Thetis," and the very interesting portrait of
Granet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was my discovery of Granet himself that
gives me my pleasantest recollection of the Aix
Museum. There is a whole room devoted to his
pencil and water-colour drawings, which contains
also many of his best known paintings. His subjects
are something of the same as those of Wilkie,
who was his contemporary, but in his composition
and beautiful effects of lighting he seems to me
an incomparably greater artist. He was a native
of Aix, and died there in 1849. I was told by
an old gossip at Avignon that he was servant
in the house of a rich amateur painter, and that
he used to lock himself into his garret, whenever
he had a moment to himself, to make his own
experiments. One day his master looked through
the keyhole and saw what he was doing. He
might, said my gossip, have been struck with
jealousy. But he was of the <i>noblesse</i>. He was
struck instead with admiration of the work that
he beheld&mdash;probably after having knocked at the
door&mdash;, greeted the valet as <i>his</i> master, and assisted
him to make his career.</p>

<p>The late afternoon was fine. I walked all
about the town, visited the remaining churches,
and paid due attention to other objects of interest.</p>

<p class="b1">Among the curiosities of Aix is the monument
of Joseph Sec, which the owner of that harmonious
name caused to be erected on the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of his garden in 1792. It faces the street, and
bears the inscription:</p>

<p class="ppn20">Venez, habitants de la terre,<br />
Nations, écoutez la loi!</p>

<p class="p1">It includes the figures of Themis and Moses,
and among other symbols two bas-reliefs of banknotes
for a hundred and two thousand francs.
The whole erection is rather absurd, although it
was the work of the sculptor Chastel. But probably
Joseph Sec was one of those patrons of the
arts who know what they want and see that they
get it. I have not the smallest doubt that Chastel,
who was a sculptor of merit, heard from him the
phrase: "I pay the piper, and it is only fair that
I should call the tune," or its French equivalent.</p>

<p>Joseph Sec called another very curious tune
to Chastel, of which M. Mariéton tells.</p>

<p>He was taken into the deserted garden behind
the monument&mdash;"the Trianon of the bourgeois
of Aix," he calls it&mdash;and into a little Louis XVI
kiosk littered with tools. In it was an old sofa,
the seat of which was lifted for him to see the
life-sized figure of a naked man in painted marble,
with a bloodstained scar on his forehead&mdash;a dreadful,
realistic representation of a workman who
had been killed by a stone falling from Joseph
Sec's monument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>How modern he was, this good bourgeois of
Aix, who died over a hundred years ago! A
taste for the arts, and money enough to indulge
it! I own that I should have tried to get a glimpse
of this artistic atrocity of his, if I had known of its
existence.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Salon and the Crau</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Ever since I first saw Les Baux, on a motoring
trip from the north to the south of France, I
had wanted to get back to it. I saw Aix and
Avignon and Nîmes and Arles at the same time,
and I wanted to get back to them. But Les Baux
was the <i>bonne bouche</i>. When I contemplated this
spring walk it was what I was thinking of as the
central point of interest of the whole expedition;
and I was thinking of it all the time I was walking
through the country during those first nine
days.</p>

<p>For it sums up the whole past of Provence.
It is connected with the Græco-Ph&oelig;nician colonies
that preceded the Roman occupation; with the
Roman occupation itself, and especially with that
stirring episode of the Marian defeat of the barbarian
invaders; with the Christian Marian
legends; almost more than any other place with
the romantic era of the Troubadours; with every
internal struggle of the many that disturbed the
country during the Middle Ages; with the religious
wars; and indeed with every movement of
significance in Provence down to the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the merging of the kingdom into that of
France.</p>

<p>After that its importance dwindled, but did
not expire until much later. When it did, its
ruin was so complete that it acquired another
sort of interest altogether. It arouses much the
same feelings now as the one-time flourishing cities
of Herculaneum and Pompeii, for it is almost
as dead as they, and its ruins tell as eloquently
of the time when it was alive. Added to which,
it is most romantically situated, in the very heart
of the country that is most characteristic of Provence
as it is today&mdash;the Provence that lives its
rich, picturesque life with an eye kept always
on its rich, picturesque past; the country of Mistral,
and the scenes of that moving epic in which
all the poetry and glamour of Provence is garnered
up: "Mireille."</p>

<p>I shouldered my pack once more, but was in
such a hurry now to get to Les Baux that I
took the train early in the morning as far as
Maussane. It was well that I did so, for the
rain fell heavily when I reached Salon, where I
had an hour to wait.</p>

<p>Nostradamus, who was born at Saint-Remy,
lived at various times at Salon, and died there.
Out of his thousand prophecies it is not surprising
that a few hit the mark, and from them he gained
an immense reputation. Exactly a hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
after his death we find Pepys writing: "Amongst
other discourse we talked much of Nostradamus,
his prophecy of these times, and Sir George Cartaret
did tell a story how at his death he did
make the town (of Salon) swear that he should
never be dug up or his tomb opened after he was
buried; but that they did after sixty years do it,
and upon his breast they found a plate of brasse
saying what a wicked, unfaithful people the people
of that place were, who after so many vows should
disturb and open him such a day and year and
hour, which, if true, is very strange." Probably
it was not true, as to the time; but he would not
have risked much if he had prophesied the fact.
He did, however, prophesy that a new era would
begin for France in the year 1792, which was a
bold shot, as it was more than two hundred years
after his death; and Napoleon is said to have
seen predictions that concerned himself in his
writings.</p>

<p>M. Mariéton tells of the fashion in which he
seized his opportunity in the town of Salon.</p>

<p>Charles IX was making a solemn progress
through Provence with his mother Catharine de'
Medici and the little Prince Henry of Navarre.
The town of Salon made elaborate preparations
for their reception, and Nostradamus was asked
where he would like to walk in the procession.
He said that he proposed to have a little procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of his own. When the royal party appeared
before the gates the queen mother looked anxiously
about for the prophet, and when she saw
him apart from the rest beckoned him to take up
his position between herself and the king. He
had been counting on something of this sort, for
he had already been in Paris, and had gained a
considerable ascendancy over Catharine. He was
lodged in the castle during the royal visit, and
invited to a solemn consultation on the subject
of the stability of the royal line. Catharine
wanted him to tell the fortune of Prince Henry.
He was quite ready to do it, and ordered the
child to be undressed, as a preliminary. The
little prince thought he was going to be whipped,
and filled the castle with his howls. When he
had calmed down, Nostradamus boldly announced
that he would come to be king.</p>

<p>If this story is true, it shows the prophet to
have been a schemer rather above his kind. Catharine
had three sons still alive, and could not have
been expected to welcome the announcement.
Nor would the young king have been particularly
pleased with it. Indeed, it may be said to have
been a prophecy not altogether free from risk to
the man who was bold enough to make it. But
he seems to have judged human nature aright.
His reputation was vastly increased by the prediction,
and Catharine summoned him to Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for the second time, which was no doubt what he
wanted.</p>

<p>The royal visit to Salon took place in the year
1564, and while the great humbug of the time
was preparing for his own little private effect
there must have been somewhere in the crowd
that filled the streets strewn with rosemary and
lavender and thyme a young man who deserved
far better to be noticed. This was Adam de
Craponne, who by that time had already begun
his work of fertilizing the Great Crau.</p>

<p class="b1">Mr. Baring-Gould, in the book already mentioned,
gives an interesting account of this "little
Sahara in Europe," which occupies 30,000 acres.</p>

<p class="pbq">"At a remote period, but, nevertheless in one
geologically modern, the vast floods of the diluvial
age that flowed from the Alps brought down
incredible quantities of rolled stones, the detritus
of the Alps.... This rubble, washed down from
the Alps, forms the substratum of the immense
plain that inclines at a very slight angle to the
Mediterranean, and extends for a considerable
distance below the sea.... There is a break in
the chain on the south, between the limestone
Alpines and the sandstone Trévaresse; and the
brimming Durance, unable to discharge all her
water, choked with rubble, into the Rhône, burst
through the open door or natural waste-pipe, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Salon, and carried a portion of her pebbles into
the sea directly, without asking her sister the
Rhône to help her. Now the two great plains
formed by the delta of the Rhône, and that of
the Durance with the Rhône, are called the Great
and the Little Crau. They were known to the
ancients, and puzzled them not a little. Strabo
says of the Great Crau: 'Between Marseilles and
the mouth of the Rhône, at about a hundred
stadia from the sea, is a plain, circular in form,
and a hundred stadia in diameter, to which a
singular event obtained for it the name of the
Field of Pebbles. It is, in fact, covered with
pebbles, as big as the fist, among which grows
some grass in sufficient abundance to pasture
heads of oxen.'"</p>

<p class="p1">The singular event referred to was the fight
between Hercules and the Ligurians. Hercules
had used up all his arrows, and had retired to
a cave in the Alpilles to make his last stand,
when Jupiter came to his assistance and rained
down a shower of stones which killed all his enemies.
When the hero, thus miraculously aided,
emerged from his cave, he saw the great plain
covered with stones as it is today. Or rather,
as it was; for thanks to Craponne and those who
came after him the desolate area is now much
circumscribed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>This legend, which is still alive in Provence,
takes us back to the very earliest times. For
Hercules is the Ph&oelig;nician Melkarth, and wherever
his name survives it is in connection with Ph&oelig;nician
trading, before the Greek colonization.</p>

<p>Craponne's scheme was to bring "some of the
waters of the Durance through the gap where
some of its overspill had flowed in the diluvial
period, by a canal, into the Great Crau, so that
it might deposit its rich alluvium over this desert
of stones. He spent his life and his entire fortune
in carrying out his scheme, and it is due to
this that year by year the barren desert shrinks,
and cultivation advances."</p>

<p>There are few things more interesting to learn
about than the bold works by which man gets
the better of nature, or rather sets nature to
work to correct, as it were, her own mistakes.
About a hundred years later than this, Vermuyden,
the Dutch engineer, started draining the Lincolnshire
and Cambridgeshire fens, a work of even
greater magnitude, which gave England some of
its richest agricultural land. The draining of
Holland was already a thing accomplished; the
draining of the Rommy marshes in Kent and
Sussex was partly effected before the Roman
conquest of Britain. Of late years Australia
has dammed up a great river, and turned a dry
valley into a lake over two hundred feet deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from which land will be irrigated as many miles
away.</p>

<p>In all these great works, varied in means but
the same in intention, the thing to be done is as
simple as a child's diversion of water on the sloping
sands of the seashore. What he does with his
wooden spade, digging his channels and building
up his banks, the engineers do with their laborious
machinery, trenching canals, and piling up the
huge masses of their dams. The waters, obeying
the few simple laws of their fall, do all the rest.</p>

<p>The greatest of all these works, and one of the
simplest in idea, was the damming of the Nile
at Assouan. More than two thousand years before
Christ the yearly rise and fall of the great
river began to be recorded, but it was not until
four thousand years later that the action was
adapted to man's more effective use. The natural
laws are there waiting, always to be trusted.
There is no scale too great, as there is none too
small, upon which they can be applied.</p>

<p>The result of this slow fertilization of the
Provençal Crau is plain to be seen from the line
that skirts it on the way to Arles. There are
great plantations of olives, each tree clipped and
pruned like a rare shrub in a conservatory, every
branch and almost every twig at an even distance
from the next, so as to get the maximum
of air and sun to the buds and the fruit. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
there are wonderful sheets of almond blossom,
sometimes covering acres. As far as the eye can
see on the level, the plain is of the richest.
There are frequent villages and homesteads, and
everywhere lines of cypresses, planted very close
together and allowed to grow as tall as they
please. These are to break the force of the <i>bise</i>,
which blows so strongly as to scoop the crops
out of the ground if they are left unprotected,
and once actually carried away the suspension
bridge between Beaucaire and Tarascon.</p>

<p>We pottered along the little single line, while
the rain still came down, but the clouds began to
look a little lighter. One of my fellow-travellers
was a young conscript who was on furlough from
his regiment in Tunis. He was a handsome,
charming-mannered youth. He said that he liked
soldiering, and there was little hardship in the life.
He wore his uniform when he was going on a
journey, because soldiers are taken at half fares
on the railways. He told me with a grin that
he was liable to be court-martialled for wearing
patent-leather boots, but on this line he thought
he might risk it. He was inclined to be facetious
at the expense of the line, and told me a story
about it that I first heard some twenty years
or so ago in connection with one of our own
railways. And he said that it was a good deal
used by companies of cinema actors; that at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
time you might find yourself in the society of
desperate characters prepared to do desperate
deeds, or slowing down between stations so that
somebody might be photographed crawling along
the footboard or the roof of the carriages. The
railway company had obligingly arranged for a
collision not long before, being glad enough to
sell some of its antiquated stock for this purpose;
and in fact, if it had not been for the money
made out of the cinema operators, it would have
closed down long before.</p>

<p>He told me something about the Crau, too.
This fertile tract through which we were passing
was very unlike the part that was still desert,
which I should be able to see from the heights
of Les Baux. It is dry and desolate, scorched
by the sun in summer, but in winter affording
pasturage for flocks and herds that are brought
down from the Alps.</p>

<p>The flocks are led by wise old goats, who know
every mile of their three weeks' journey; then
come the she-goats, and after them the innumerable
company of sheep. The dogs of the shepherds
surround the flock, and the rear of the procession
is brought up by asses, carrying the baggage, and
the little lambs that are too young to follow their
dams. Every night the great flock is shut in with
hurdles, and the shepherds keep guard over them.
There are said to be two or three hundred thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sheep in the flocks that make these yearly
migrations, which have been going on for hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of years. Pliny mentions
them, and there is little doubt that the order
followed in his day was much the same as it is
now. For the primal industries of the world do
not change much, and in this ancient land scarcely
at all.</p>

<p>I asked my young soldier if he had ever seen
the flights of flamingoes that are said to make
lovely the desert of the Crau, but I do not think
that he had, although he would not say that they
were not to be seen. He expressed himself with
admiration and affection about his beautiful country
of Provence, and especially about this corner
of it, in which he had been brought up. A station
or two before we reached Maussane, he got
out. There was an open carriage waiting for
him, and an elderly, prosperous-looking gentleman
in it whom I took to be his uncle, on no grounds
except that I liked to think of him during his
holiday coming out from Salon to visit relations
who lived in some roomy, picturesque "mas,"
where there was welcome and good cheer for him
in the hospitable old-fashioned way of the country.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Les Baux</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">As I got out of the train the rain ceased, though
there looked to be more to come, and I walked
the three miles to Les Baux with the sun shining,
and the birds singing among the drenched leaves
of the trees.</p>

<p>I was faced by the craggy rampart of the
Alpilles, which hang over the great plain, and
were once sea cliffs washed by the Mediterranean.
They are of white limestone, and rise in places to
a height of close upon a thousand feet. Just at
this point they thrust themselves forward in a
series of fantastic crags, rising up sheer from the
plain and crowned by great masses of gleaming
rocks that look almost as if they had been placed
there by some giant hand.</p>

<p>I knew that Les Baux was upon one of these
crags, and thought that I remembered which it
was. But there was nothing of it to be seen from
the plain. The line of cliffs was quite bare; the
road might have been leading over some deserted
col to fairer regions beyond. No one could have
guessed himself to be nearing the remains of a
once flourishing city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The road led up through a fertile valley in
which there were fields and scattered houses and
gardens, and some sort of a mill. The cliff rose
abruptly to the right, and at a turn of the road&mdash;the
green valley now lying some way below&mdash;there
came into view the walls of a few houses.
They were perched up high overhead, and seemed
to be growing out of the cliff itself, as indeed
they were; for half of this strange city is built
out of the solid rock, and its ruins remain part
of the cliff from which they were hewn.</p>

<p>The road has been remade, so that it now zigzags
steeply to an entrance from the north. But
the foot passenger can leave it and take a still
steeper track to the ancient gateway that was once
the chief entrance into this eagle's aerie. It is
called the Porte d'Eyguières, and is still in a
good state of preservation, with the grooves of
its portcullis to be seen, and a stone bearing the
arms of the Lords of Les Baux&mdash;the star with
sixteen rays which marks their descent from
Balthasar, one of the wise kings from the East,
who brought gifts to the Infant Christ.</p>

<p>A steep and narrow lane leads up through the
still inhabited quarter of the town, past the old
but rebuilt Hôtel de Ville to the place where the
new road comes in and the two inns are situated.
So far there is nothing particularly to strike the
visitor&mdash;nothing at all to compare for picturesqueness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
with the old hill towns of western Provence,
from which I had come. Picturesqueness is not
the note of Les Baux, and in the lower quarter
of the town the air is rather that of a poor village
which contains the bare remnants of some past
importance.</p>

<p>But as one mounts up towards the summit of
the crag this impression of something like squalor
gives place to a very different one. The inhabited
cottages are soon left behind. They have already
been seen to be interspersed with the ruins of
noble mansions, and to be themselves, for the most
part, salvage from greater buildings. They line
a narrow, winding street, paved with rock in
which the ruts of old cartwheels are worn, just
as they are in the streets of Pompeii. And now
there is nothing but ruin on either side, except
where part of a great house has been put into
some sort of repair for the purposes of a museum.
It is ruin complete and irreparable; but it is not
like other ruins. There stands up a bare wall,
with apertures for windows and doors; and it is
seen to be, not the remains of a structure of
built-up stones, but a shell of living rock, from
which the inside has been scooped, like a cheese
with nothing left but the rind.</p>

<p>Now one is on the summit of the crag. It is
a wide, grassy platform, upon which rear themselves
huge masses of rock cut into the forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
towers and battlements, like a giant's castle in
some fantastic dream.</p>

<p>The castle itself stands back on the northern
edge of the cliff. Nearer at hand are the remains
of dwellings that are nothing but caves in great
jutting masses of rock. But they are caves with
a difference. They are carefully squared chambers,
with chimney places still showing the marks
of fire, with holes into the walls that were once
cupboards, with ceilings cut into so as to provide
hanging for lamps. They are open to the south,
and the entrances blocked with débris; but there is
no doubt that they were once merely the back
parts of houses, which showed fronts as well built
as some of those still standing in the streets below.</p>

<p>The grassy height is strewn with the stones of
many buildings quite destroyed, but once it contained
the ordered precincts of the great pile that
nothing has been able completely to destroy. It
stands grim and majestic, towering over the whole
mass of tumbled walls and the few roofs and chimneys
that are all that remain of the rich city.
One can see stone stairs and galleries high up in
the rock and can mount up to some of them.
The dungeon, cut out of solid stone, shows a
yawning hole in the ground. It lies open to the
sky, but the ribs of its vaulting are still seen
springing from the corners. Two sides of a rock
hard by are scooped into cells. This was the
great castle dovecot. There is a little ruined
chapel, its roof delicately carved.</p>

<p class="p1">From the summit of the castle there is a magnificent
view of the great plain to the south.
It includes the whole extent of the Crau; and
now you can see which part of it has been fertilized,
with the threads of canals running through
it, and which part still remains in its stony desolation.
The great lagoon, called the Etang de
Berre, lies a glistening sheet almost on the horizon,
and you can just descry the line of the sea beyond
it. To the right you see Arles and the famous
abbey of Montmajour, and the Rhône rolling its
turgid waters through the plain of the Camarque,
to where Stes. Maries rears its fortress church
on the edge of the sea, and the holy men and
women from Palestine miraculously landed. It
is very far away, but there is hardly so much as
a hillock between you and it.</p>

<p>From here too can be seen the strange, blanched
desolation of the valleys that creep up into the
solitudes of these stony hills. They are strewn
with gigantic rocks that take on all sorts of fantastic
tortured shapes. Part of it is called the
Val d'Enfer, and it is said that Dante, who is
known to have sojourned in Arles, took from it
the scenery of his Inferno. In the spring it is
lightened with the delicate flush of almond blossom,
and Les Baux is beautiful with the silvers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and blues and purples of its surrounding country,
and its own wild aspect of strength and desolation.
But its appeal is to the past, and without
some knowledge of its history it must present itself
as an almost undecipherable riddle.</p>

<p>We need not linger over the importance that
this natural fortress had in the time of Marius,
who had camps very near to Les Baux, and perhaps
on the very spot; nor the story of the Christians
who were driven to take refuge here by
Alaric the Visigoth. The first of the long line
of the counts of Les Baux who is known to history
was Leibulf, who lived at the end of the
eighth century. From that time, until the year
1426, when the death of the Princess Alix at last
brought it to an end, it continually increased in
wealth and importance, until it vied with the rest
of the royal houses in Europe. Yes; this deserted,
almost forgotten city, which now contains a bare
hundred of inhabitants, was the seat of princes
who intermarried with the reigning families of
England, France, Poland, Savoy, Nassau, Brunswick
and many more. It was the centre of a
principality that included seventy-nine towns and
bourgs, villages, or castles. Its rulers were
Princes of Orange, besides, from which our own
royal house is sprung; they derived titles from
Milan, Naples, Piedmont, Marseilles and elsewhere;
they were kings of Arles and Vienne;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Princes of Achaia, Counts of Provence, Cephalonia,
Spoleto, and other places; finally emperors
of Constantinople, and that this was not an empty
title is shown by the fact that an embassy was
sent to a reigning princess of Les Baux to treat
for her rights as empress. In the twelfth century
the towns owned by the prince of Les Baux included
Aix, Saint-Remy, Salon, Pertvis, and the
Bourg-Neuf at Arles. The possessions of "La
Baussenique" already made of it a second Provence.
Indeed, Raymond des Baux, who died in
1150, claimed, through his marriage with the
daughter of the Count of Provence, the whole
of the country, and fought for it until his death.</p>

<p>There was continual fighting, with Les Baux
as its centre, during the Middle Ages, and sometimes
its lords were on the summit of fortune,
sometimes forced to give up some of their lands.
They fought with the Saracen corsairs, with the
counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon, with
the counts of Anjou and Poitou, the king of
Naples, and many more. They went crusading
with the rest, and one of them is mentioned with
honour in the pages of Froissart.</p>

<p>It was at the siege of La Reole in Gascony.
The Earl of Derby lay before it for nine weeks,
and the townspeople were so reduced by starvation
that they wished the place to be given up. But
Sir Agos des Baux, who commanded the troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would not consent to this, and retired to the castle,
with plenty of wine and other provisions. The
castle had been erected by the Saracens, and was
much stronger than the English had supposed.
So they prepared to mine under it, and then the
garrison grew alarmed. So "Sir Agous dyscendedde
downe fro the hygh towre, and dyd put
out his heed at a lytell wyndo, and make a token
to speke with some of the host." Lord Derby,
Sir Walter Manny and Lord Stafford came to
parley with him, and he offered to give up the
fortress if he and his troops might retain "our
lyves and goodes saved." Lord Derby replied,
"Sir Agos, Sir Agos, you will not get off so. We
know your distress, and will receive only an unconditional
surrender." Then Sir Agos said that
he would trust to the honour of the English, and
Lord Derby, commending his gallantry, granted
honourable surrender to the garrison, with their
armour.</p>

<p>"Then they dyd on their harnesse and toke
their horses, whereof they hadde no mo but sixe;
some bought horses of thenglysshmen, the whiche
they payed for truely. Thus Sir Agous de Baus
departed fro the Ryoll, and yelded up the castele
to the Englysshemen, and Sir Agos and his company
wente to Tholons."</p>

<p>One of the bloodiest struggles of all that had
surrounded Les Baux took place when the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Alix succeeded to its sovereignty at the age
of seven, and it was twenty-six long years before
she was able, as a widow, to take up her residence
in her much battered but still noble castle.</p>

<p>She was the ward of the Viscount of Turenne,
the "Scourge of Provence," who married her at
the age of thirteen to a young noble whom he
thought he could use for his own purposes, which
were of course to get possession of his ward's
property. But Adon de Villers unexpectedly decided
to fight him, and succeeded in gaining valuable
support, from the neighbouring cities, and
from the Pope himself, who was then seated at
Avignon. Besides men at arms, the Pope launched
a threat of excommunication against Turenne, who
laughed at it, and said that for a thousand florins
he could get more soldiers than the Pope for
seven years of plenary absolution. He was not
in the least particular where he got his fighters
from. He allowed a robber-chief to seize and
sack Les Baux itself and to murder and pillage
in all the country round, and he roused the Mediterranean
pirates to spread further devastation
through the lands of his ward.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, the Pope who had been
deified died, and it happened that the King of
France had a quarrel with his successor and sent
troops against him under Marshal Boucicaut.
When this little affair was settled Boucicaut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
turned his attention to Turenne, whose daughter
he had married. As persuasion was useless, he
besieged and took Les Baux and other towns, and
Turenne was brought to his knees. He broke
out again immediately afterwards, and there is
no knowing how much longer the poor Princess
Alix could have been kept out of her rights if
he had not been accidentally drowned while he
was crossing the Rhône.</p>

<p>Her castle was almost defenceless, but she married
again and lived in it in peace for another
twenty-four years. When she lay dying, it is
said that a bright star descended from the heavens
and entered her room, hanging over her until she
breathed her last, when it faded away. It was
thought to be that very Star of the East which
had shone upon the founder of her long race, now
extinguished with her.</p>

<p>Mr. T. A. Cook, in his admirable book on
Provence, from which I have chiefly drawn for
the above facts, gives an account of the inventory
of Princess Alix's household effects, made for the
crown after her death. It makes a welcome impression
of peace and luxury, which no one can
feel inclined to grudge this much-tried lady after
the strife and bloodshed with which half of her
life had been surrounded, and shows the grim
castle of Les Baux in a light that is pleasant to
contemplate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"The entrance-courtyard of the château lay
to the south. The chapel of Ste. Marie, with its
vaulted roof, was in the rez-de chaussée, near several
large reception-rooms, with kitchens, bakery,
larders, and cellars beneath them. Above were
fifteen more out of the thirty-five rooms. That
in which Alix died was situated in a tower, beneath
a granary. It was furnished with two candlesticks
of silver, with plate of silver and of gold,
with many lengths of tapestry, and with fine Eastern
rugs. In the oaken chests were robes of silk
and velvet, of cloth of gold, and 'vair'; furs,
belts, eight rosaries set with pearls, prayer-books,
and books of hours, bound in red cloth of gold,
with clasps of silver-gilt. Within the 'Chambre
de la Rose' were more books of prayer, bound
in cloth of gold and pearls, and set in a case of
stamped leather, bound with a silver band all gilt
with fleurs de lys. The chapel and its vestry
were filled with rich ecclesiastical garments and
plate, chalices, pattens, candlesticks, and reading-desks,
in gold and silver-gilt, enriched with gems,
enamel, and embroidery, a number of illuminated
liturgies, and a set of tapestries, showing the adoration
of the Magi, with Balthasar, the traditional
ancestor of the house. In other rooms were tables
with huge legs enriched with carving, long seats
that opened to form linen-chests, sideboards in
solid worked wood, cupboards let straight into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
stone, and lined with cedar. In the larders and
cellars were tuns of wine, both white and red,
great store of nuts and grain, piles of salt beef
and pork, rows of fishing-nets, and stronger nets
for hunting the stag and the wild boar; with herds
of cattle, pigs, and sheep, in the pastures below,
and nearly fifty chickens. In the halls and passages
were trophies of arms, cuirasses, helmets,
arbalètes, coulevrines, bombardelles, lances; and
swords; 'the most of them rusty,' for their day
was over; the furniture was partly sold by order
of the king, partly bequeathed to the Bishop of
Tortosa, and partly sent over to the Château of
Tarascon."</p>

<p class="p2">The princedom of Les Baux now became
merged in that of Provence, and a few years
later the good King René succeeded to its honours.
As Les Baux had been famous in the annals
of the Troubadours, it is probable that he
took considerable interest in the romantic place.
He restored the ramparts and the towers of the
castle, and made over the barony for life to his
second wife, Jeanne de Laval, whose kneeling
figure faces him in the Triptych at Aix. There
is a charming little reminder of her still to be
seen at Les Baux. In the valley beneath the
fortress-rock is a square walled-in field which was
once a garden. In a corner of it is a little stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pavilion with delicately carved Renaissance work,
upon which time and weather have had very little
effect. There was once one of these in each corner,
but all signs of the others have disappeared, as
well as the "knots" and parterres and treillages
and the beds of sweet smelling herbs that lay between
them. The one that is left is called the
Pavillon de la Reine Jeanne, and if it did not,
actually belong to her, which it probably did not,
for she would have had her pleasaunce nearer to
the castle, it must have given delight to some fair
lady of her court, or to the wife of one of the
Provençal nobles whose mansions lined the narrow
streets of Les Baux. Fine as their remains show
them to have been, they had no more ground attached
to them than a house in a street of Mayfair,
and it is agreeable to think that it was possible
at this time for the ladies of Les Baux to
enjoy a garden outside the fortifications, and
not to be cooped up day after day within the
protecting walls.</p>

<p>Soon after the principality of Les Baux became
merged in that of Provence, Provence itself
came to the throne of France. Louis XI was on
the throne, and in the last year of his reign he
ordered the destruction of the ramparts and the
castle of Les Baux. It was not the first time that
the castle had been destroyed, and it was not to be
the last. Its immense strength seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
given it a sort of vitality that suffered dismemberment
without complete destruction, and even
now it seems not to be quite dead, though it is
long since it was at last rendered uninhabitable.
Probably on this occasion it was only the offensive
and defensive parts of the castle that were destroyed,
for fifty years later, during a royal
progress through Provence, Francis I visited it
with a brilliant train, and was entertained there
by his own High Constable, Anne de Montmorency,
to whom he had given the barony of Les
Baux. Another royal visit, in 1614, ended in
sad disaster. The Duc de Guise was entertained
one Sunday in May in the castle, and at every
toast that was drunk there was a salvo of artillery.
Being probably a little flushed with wine,
the prince announced his intention of firing a cannon
himself. The cannon exploded and shattered
his leg, and a few days later he was buried at St.
Trophime in Arles.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century Les Baux, still in the
thick of whatever strife was going forward, became
the battleground of Catholics and Protestants.
In 1543 Claude de Savoie, Count of
Tende, who was Seneschal of Provence, took up
his residence in the castle, and stayed there for a
year trying to bring peace between the factions.
In 1561 the Protestants got into Les Baux, and
made havoc, quite in the old-fashioned way. In
three months they were turned out, not at all
gently. But two years later they were back
again, not only free to practise their religion,
but with the governor, Jehan de Manville, a convert
to it. He converted part of his house into
a chapel to the Huguenots. The house is in ruins,
but there is enough left to show what a fine one
it was, and among the remains is a pedimented
Renaissance window of the chapel, with the famous
Reformation motto carved over it in stone:
"Post Tenebras Lux," and the date 1571.</p>

<p class="p1">This family of Manvilles is the most important
in the annals of Les Baux after that of its titulary
princes. They held some sort of seignorial authority
for about a hundred years, but in 1621 the
fourth and last of them had to resign his rights
for continuing to harbour the Protestants.</p>

<p>A few years later the prosperity of Les Baux
departed. Louis XIII sent troops against its last
seigneur, Antoine de Villeneuve, who was an adherent
of the Duke of Orleans, and Richelieu ordered
the final destruction of the castle.</p>

<p>This time the work was done thoroughly. But
the stout old pile made a resistance of its own.
It took a month to demolish it, and gunpowder
had to be used to blow it up. And even now there
is a great deal of it left.</p>

<p>After that Les Baux steadily declined until it
became no more than a refuge for a handful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
peasants, who squatted amongst the ruins, fed
their sheep where the grass grew over the castle
courts, and cultivated a few fields outside. But
it kept one church out of its five or six, and has
always had some sort of corporate life. It is
a little more prosperous now, because of its visitors;
but compared with its rich past the life is
a mere trickle, and only the ruins remain to tell
of what it once was.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Les Baux</i> (continued)</p>

<p class="pn p2">Mr. Cook had written of the inn at Les Baux
that lunch was "a perilous adventure, and any
other form of hospitality impossible." This did
not frighten me, because when one takes a pack
on one's back one drops a good many prejudices.
Read what the inns were like when Smollett travelled
through France, or Casanova, or Arthur
Young. Probably the inn at Les Baux, when
Mr. Cook visited it, would have seemed to an
eighteenth century traveller a most desirable place
of entertainment. At any rate, the reproach is
now removed altogether, for there is an excellent
inn at Les Baux. It is called the Hôtel de la
Reine Jeanne.</p>

<p>The other inn is called the "Hôtel de Monte
Carlo," which recalls a curious episode in the history
of Les Baux&mdash;the last in its long history.</p>

<p class="b1">It was after Richelieu had wrecked it, and was
caused, says Mr. Cook, by the ambition of Spain
to become possessed of Monte Carlo.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The young Honoré de Grimaldi, seeking the
protection of Louis XIII, who had no desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
see the Spaniards conveniently planted between
Genoa and Nice, so near to his own territories,
arranged by the Treaty of Péronne for the independence
of Monaco, and the protection of a
French garrison, in 1641, together with sufficient
lands in France to compensate for the loss of any
Italian revenues confiscated by Spain. Grimaldi
got the Spaniards out of Monaco by a cleverly
audacious ruse, and was rewarded by lands in
France which were called his Duchy of Valentinois;
and in 1643 Les Baux was created a marquisate
in the possession of the Grimaldis, Princes
of Monaco, and Dukes of Valentinois. The title
that had been held by Diane de Poitiers, and by
Cæsar Borgia, added perhaps the last touch of
sinister romance that was needed to complete the
history of Les Baux. A little country pleasure-house,
beneath the ruins of the fort, was enough
for the Grimaldis; and even that was knocked to
pieces by the Revolution, which also cut down
every forest on the mountain-slopes."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class="p1">This "Hôtel de Monte Carlo" used to be
called "A la Chevelure d'Or."</p>

<p>Some years ago when the pavement of the
church was undergoing repair there was found the
body of a beautiful young girl, wrapped in a
mantle of her own golden hair. It fell to dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
when exposed, all but the long strands of hair
which the innkeeper possessed himself of and displayed
in his tavern. When he left Les Baux
he took the "Cabelladuro d'Or" with him, but
a tress of it is now in the Musée Arlaten at Arles.
The rock beneath the church is honeycombed with
graves of the knights and ladies of old time, and
this fair girl is supposed to have been the Princess
Strella of Florence, who came to Les Baux to
marry the Reine Jeanne's seneschal, but died
instead, and was buried beneath the stone on
which she would have stood to be wedded. A
sad little story, very real at the time, then forgotten
for four hundred years, and now again
real enough to touch the heart!</p>

<p>All that afternoon and evening I wandered
about among the ruins of the deserted city. I
call it deserted because the greater part of it is
actually so, and the life of the part that is inhabited
is so different from the life it once enshrined
that it has little power to change the
meaning of the old buildings in which it shelters.</p>

<p>The church is perhaps an exception, for so many
churches as ancient as this have survived. But
if you sit in its darkness and silence for a time
the present drops away from you and you are
back again in the days when it rang with the tread
of mailed knights and rustled with the silks and
satins of their ladies. It has been clumsily enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
restored without, but inside it is much as it was
centuries ago. The south aisle is the oldest, and
it has three chapels, as well as an altar, scooped
out of the living rock. Mr. Cook reminds us of
Dumas' visit to it. "As he entered the little,
cold, dark building (in the days before its restoration)
he heard a sound of sorrow at the eastern
end. Upon an open bier, before the high altar,
lay the dead body of a little girl. Her two tiny
sisters knelt on either side. Her mother sat crying
in a corner, and continued sobbing after the
good Alexandre had thrown her his whole purse.
Her little brother tried to toll the bell for a service
at which no priest was present. A dozen or
so of beggars had looked in to see the sight.
They comprised the whole population of Les
Baux."</p>

<p>In front of the church is a terrace overlooking
the valley in which is the garden with the pavilion.
In one corner of it are the ruins of a chapel of
the White Penitents. On the other side the rock
rises sheer and steep, and in it is hollowed out a
semi-circular cistern called the Deïmo. Into this
the vassals of the Lords of Les Baux poured their
tithes of wine and corn and olive oil.</p>

<p>One can picture this terrace on a sunny spring
morning filled with the people who had just come
out from hearing Mass in the church. They would
linger awhile to gossip by the stone parapet, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
round the steps of the cross in the middle of the
little <i>place</i>, before they went off to their fine
houses in the narrow streets. Les Baux was a
favourite residence of the Provencal nobility in
its more peaceful days. Hardly less interesting
than the ruins of the castle and the older houses
are those of the fifteenth and sixteenth century
mansions, with their noble proportions and their
rich decoration.</p>

<p>One of them, hard by the church, is still standing,
and is used as a school. You can get permission
to see its vaulted frescoed hall. It belonged
to the noble family of the Porcelets, the origin
of whose name is legendary.</p>

<p>A proud lady of the family drove away a
beggar woman, rebuking her for bringing into the
world more children than she could provide for.
The beggar chanced to be a witch, as so frequently
happened in such circumstances, and
prophesied in return that the lady herself would
bear as many children as there should be little
pigs in the litter of a sow that was near them.
The sow produced nine <i>porcelets</i>, and the lady as
many children, who with their descendants were
thenceforward called Porcelet.</p>

<p>If only one could catch just one glimpse of
the place as it was in the days of high romance!
It would be impossible to dip anywhere into the
history of song and chivalry in the south during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the Middle Ages without coming across mention
of Les Baux. Some of its princes were noted
Troubadours, knights and ladies thronged its
Courts of Love, and the names of its queens ring
musically through the poetry that was made there.
Passe-Rose, Douce, Etiennette, Adélasie, Briande,
Clairette, Barbe, Aybeline, Baussette&mdash;how sweet
they sound! And there are stories to be told of
all of them.</p>

<p>Characteristic of the times is that of the fair
Azalais, wife of Count Barral des Baux. Her
charms were sung by the famous Troubadour,
Foulquet of Marseilles, but "neither by his
prayers nor by his songs could he ever move her
to show him favour by right of love." Whether
or no he actually transferred his affections to his
lady's young sister-in-law, Laura, or only pretended
to do so, Azalais took umbrage, and
"would have no more of his prayers or fine
words." So, "he left off singing and laughing,
for he had lost the lady whom he loved more than
the whole world." But his homage continued,
and we hear no more of Laura.</p>

<p>Barral des Baux grew tired of his countess and
divorced her, but Foulquet, in spite of his friendship
with her husband, maintained his allegiance
to Azalais. At last he wearied of his fruitless
sighing, and took the cowl. He rose to be Bishop
of Toulouse, and his name lives, not as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the greatest poets of his time, which he was, but
as the cruel persecutor of the Albigensian
heretics.</p>

<p>As one mounts towards the summit of the rock
one sees the ruins of yet other churches and
chapels, and on the grassy plateau is a wide space
that was once used as an arena for bull-fights,
but before that was the site of a hospital for lepers,
of which there were many in Les Baux during
the seventeenth century. In the foundations of
the walls that are left can be seen the recesses
for the beds of the patients cut into the rock.</p>

<p>It rained a good deal that afternoon, but as I
was standing on the summit of the rock in the
evening, looking out over the plain, the sun sank
into a clear belt of sky between the clouds, and
the whole wide landscape, with its encircling hills,
was bathed in a glory of golden light. I turned,
and almost held my breath at the beauty that was
revealed to me. The setting sun had caught the
ruins of the castle, and it was glowing in the
unearthly light, like a fairy palace, while the
walls and roofs below it were still in shadow.
The deep blues and purples of the hills beyond
were indescribably lovely. I could not expect to
get a reminder of their beauty; but the castle,
standing out like that&mdash;I might get it in a photograph.
I turned and ran down the steep street
to get my camera. I had carried it about with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
me all day, but had left it behind for my evening
stroll. As I hurried up to the top again, the sun
was just touching the lower bank of heavy cloud.
As I ran towards the first place from which I
could possibly get a view, the light slowly faded
from the towers and battlements; as I reached it,
it died away altogether. The ruins were once
more cold and grim and forbidding.</p>

<p>It was the more disappointing because it is
very difficult to get any view of Les Baux that
is characteristic of the place as a whole. The castle
stands up boldly from the north-east, but even
there the rock on which it is built does not show
its height. The view of the town taken from the
castle gives some idea of its situation, with the
rocks on the other side of the valley and the plain
spread out below; but it is only a fragment, after
all, and the only photograph I took of it that
"came out" was when there was a driving scud
of rain that blotted out the view, and shows few
details of the foreground.</p>

<p>Another trouble came upon me that night. I
was walking through a narrow street in the darkness
when a big dog rushed out of a doorway
and made for me. I turned quickly to defend
myself, and at the same time a man standing in
the doorway shouted at the dog and picked up
a stone to throw at it. I felt a sudden pain in
the calf of my leg, and thought that the dog
had bitten me, or a stone had hit me, very sharply.
But it was a split muscle, and it kept me laid
up in Les Baux for two days longer than I had
intended. And that produced the greatest disappointment
of all. On Sunday I should have gone
to Maillane, on my way to Avignon, and seen
Mistral, who was then quite well, and who liked
to see visitors. But on Monday I could not walk
so far, and put off the visit till later; and on
Monday Mistral was taken ill with the illness
from which he died on Wednesday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But this further disappointment was hidden
from me at the time, and I spent the next two
days hobbling about Les Baux and getting an
indelible impression of it, as familiarity with its
nooks and corners increased. It became, by degrees,
not so much a ruined city as a city of
ruined houses, with a character to each. There
are many intersecting streets and lanes, and as
one poked about them here and there, some faint
shadow of reality made itself felt above the destruction.
Little bits of staircases, windows,
hearths, chimneys, stood out from the mass of
heaped stones. One could imagine the houses
whole and clean and occupied. From some life
seemed only recently to have departed, though
they had been left to decay for centuries. The
ghosts of the men and women of the past were
very near to showing themselves, especially at dark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
when what is preserved and what is destroyed was
difficult to distinguish.</p>

<p>I spent much time on the quiet grassy summit
of the rock. A few sheep are fed there, and the
shepherds watch them, as they always do in this
country, sitting in the shade of some ruin or leaning
over the rough stone parapet to look at the
valley below. An old inhabitant came up to read
his paper there, as he told me he did every evening
when it was fine, and we saw the first swallow
of the summer as we talked. The children came
to cut plants for salads, busily turning over the
stones and filling their wire baskets. They are
very friendly, the children of Les Baux. When
I had been there two years ago a slim little dark-eyed
girl of twelve had shown me the church, and
I had taken her photograph sitting on the steps
of the cross. Now I found her grown into a
young woman, and present her here as one of the
beauties of Les Baux. Her name is Martha
Montfort and I wondered if perhaps she was
a descendant of the great Montforts. For our
Simon de Montfort's father was Count of Toulouse,
and campaigned it here against the Albigenses.</p>

<p class="b1">The people at the inn were very kind to me
over my accident, provided me with embrocation
and cotton wool and the best of advice, and sent
me away nearly cured. Mistral had visited them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in the early days of their occupancy, and had written
in their visitors' book, in his fine delicate hand,
the following poem:</p>

<p class="ppi20">Fiéu de Maiano<br />
S'ère vengu d'ou tèms</p>
<p class="ppi20">de Dono Jano<br />
Quand èro à soun printems</p>

m'aurié donna'n mantèu<br />
pèr parèisse au cassèn.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">One can get the lilt of the soft Provençal, in
which the poet sings so sweetly, and with the
French translation, added in his own hand, make
out the sense.</p>

<p class="ppi20">Fils de Maillanne,<br />
Si j'étais venu au temps</p>
<p class="ppi20">de Madame Jeanne,<br />
Comme ou l'était dans sa fleur</p>
<p class="ppi20">et Souveraine,<br />

<p class="ppi20">trouvé, moi bienheureux,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mistral would certainly have been rewarded
if he had appeared at the castle of Les Baux in
the time of the Troubadours. He sings in the
same tongue, poems at least as beautiful as any
that they have left behind them. He was anxious
that the <i>patronne</i> of the inn should wear the
Provençal costume, and I do not wonder at it,
for although she is a Swiss from Valais, she has
the regular features and the stately bearing of
the Arlesiennes who are said to be the most
beautiful women in Europe.</p>

<p>I found an English artist settled at Les Baux.
He had bought one of the old houses and restored
part of it, a great deal with his own hands.
We sat and talked in a large upstairs room with
a fine open fireplace and the window open to the
western valley and the hills beyond it. And on
Sunday we visited the Val d'Enfer together, and
the chapel of the Trois Maries, or the "Trémaïé."</p>

<p>The carved stone in front of which this little
shrine is built&mdash;it lies under the castle rock to the
west&mdash;supplies the key to much that we have already
heard about. It is one of the great limestone
rocks with which the hillside and the valley
are littered&mdash;about twenty-five feet high, and is
a semi-circular niche twelve feet or so from the
ground containing the weathered carving of these
draped figures, nearly life-size.</p>

<p>At first sight they appear to be those of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
women, and for centuries the tradition has been
that they were the three Marys who landed with
the other saints at Stes. Maries de la Mer. But
the carving is Roman, and the figures are Roman,
dressed quite recognizably in togas and tunics,
the right-hand figure facing us is a man, the other
two are women, the one in the middle, taller than
the others and wearing a sort of turban and
carrying a rod decorated with foliage, though this
is not easy to make out now. But it is not difficult
to identify the three figures. There is a wealth
of evidence to show that they are contemporary
portraits of Caius Marius, his wife Julia, and in
the middle Martha the prophetess who attended
Marius in his campaign against the barbarians.</p>

<p>"For he had with him," writes Plutarch, "a
Syrian woman named Martha, who was said to
have the gift of prophecy. She was carried about
in a litter with great respect and solemnity, and
the sacrifices he offered were all by her direction.
She had formerly applied to the senate in this
character, and made an offer of predicting for
them future events, but they refused to hear her.
Then she betook herself to the women, and gave
them a specimen of her art. She addressed herself
particularly to the wife of Marius, at whose
feet she happened to sit when there was a combat
of gladiators, and fortunately enough told her
which of them would prove victorious. Marius's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wife sent her to her husband, who received her
with the utmost veneration, and provided for her
the litter in which she was generally carried.
When she went to sacrifice she wore a purple
robe lined with the same, and buttoned up, and
held in her hand a spear adorned with ribbons and
garlands."</p>

<p class="p2">The inscription below the figures has almost
entirely disappeared; but enough remains to show
its date, and the name of the sculptor, Caldus.
Mr. Cook makes the interesting suggestion that
this may have been "that plebeian partisan of
Marius, who forged his own way to the front,
was made tribune in 107 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and won his honours
by hard work like his master." For "he was
lieutenant at Les Baux with Marius before he
went to Spain; and in memory of his Spanish
campaigns he struck the gold medals which record
his rise to the consulate in 97 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>"</p>

<p>Here then are the three Marii: Caius Marius,
Martha Marii, and Julia Marii; and as is the
way of such things they became presently transformed
to the three Maries, and a whole new tradition
was attached to them. There is little doubt
either that Martha the sister of Mary who rid
Provence of the scourge of the dragon derived
from Martha the companion of Marius, who rid
it of the scourge of the barbarians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the rock of the Trémaïé is that
of the Gaïé which bears the much mutilated carving
of two figures which are probably those of
Caius Marius and his wife Julia, or possibly of
Martha.</p>

<p>These two stones, and especially the Trémaïé,
are from one point of view the most interesting
remains in the whole of Provence; for they join
on the past to a past still more remote, and a story
that took two thousand years in the telling is made
plain.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Mistral</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">I started early on Monday morning to walk to
Saint-Remy. It was fine and sunny again, but
there was a touch of the <i>mistral</i>. The road winds
up through the limestone crags to a <i>col</i> from which
there is a view even more magnificent than that
from Les Baux to the south. The undulating
plain, all silver and delicate green and indigo
and deep purple, stretches away on either hand,
and very far away rise the snow peaks of the
Pyrenees, like mountains in a dream. The Rhône
and the Durance are at about equal distances
to the right and left, the Durance flowing on one
side of the Alpilles to join her sister at Avignon,
and both these together passing the other side
on their way to the sea. Beyond Avignon are
the heights of the Cevennes and the Basses-Alpes
to close in the picture, of which the foreground
is the very heart of the rich and picturesque Provençal
country.</p>

<p>The life of the soil, as it existed for hundreds
of years, and exists still though shorn of some
of its character since the days of steam, has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
immortalized by Mistral, who was born in the
village of Maillane a few miles off the road I was
taking that day, spent all his life there, and was
to die two days later. All its sweet charm is
summed up in the great epic of "Mirèio," or
"Mireille" published when he was twenty-five
and instantly hailed by no less a critic than
Lamartine as a work of genius. I had been reading
it at Les Baux, in a version in which a French
rendering&mdash;prepared, I am told, by Mistral himself&mdash;is
printed parallel to the Provençal. It
was possible to get an idea of the swing and mastery
of the original verse. With some knowledge
of Latin and French, with a few simple rules
of pronunciation, which were given in the Introduction,
and with the ear attuned somewhat to
the sounds&mdash;for I had constantly heard Provençal
spoken&mdash;I could take a stanza here and there
and make it out. But one was carried along by
the translation, even though it was in prose, and
I could not put it down until I had finished its
twelve books.</p>

<p>The story is of the innocent burning loves of
a youth, the son of a wandering basket-maker, and
of a young girl, the daughter of a rich farmer.
The earliest books are full of simple and beautiful
feeling for the common episodes of country life,
as they unrolled themselves before the poet's own
eyes at the time he was writing of them. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
see the basket-maker and his son joining the master
of the farm, his family, and his numerous dependents,
at their meal on the long stone table
under the vine-trellis in front of the house, and
hear the stories they tell; we see the girls picking
the mulberry leaves from the trees, and winding
the silk from the cocoons, their hands and tongues
alike busy; and hear wise talk of seasons and
crops, and of all the active pastoral and agricultural
life of the country.</p>

<p>There come three rich suitors for the hand of
the fair Mireille; a man of mighty flocks, who
brings his sheep and goats down from the high
Alps to winter on the Crau; the owner of troops
of horses running wild on the windy marshes of
the Camarque; and the strong tamer of bulls,
tales of whose strength and prowess ring through
the country, who fights a Homeric battle with
the young lover, is defeated by him, but by a
stroke of malevolent cunning leaves him for dead
before he goes to his own death in the flooded
river.</p>

<p>The after scenes have immortalized the Grotto
des Fées in the Val d'Enfer of Les Baux, and
the pilgrimage church of Saintes-Maries, in which
Mireille dies, after hearing from the saints themselves
the story of their miraculous voyage and
their landing in Provence. All the scenes of the
poem are laid within a few miles of Mistral's
home, and neither in this poem nor in any other
has he drawn inspiration except from the life and
legends of his own Provence.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">He has told the story of his own life in a
charming book. His father was of the old
peasant aristocracy of the country of Arles, and
married his second wife, Mistral's mother, when
he was already fifty-five.</p>

<p class="pbq">"One year, on St. John's day, the master,
François Mistral, was in his cornfields, which the
harvesters were cutting with their sickles. A
crowd of women followed the reapers to pick
up the grain which escaped the rake. Soon my
father noticed a pretty girl who hung behind them
as if she were afraid to glean like the others. He
approached her and said:</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Where do you come from, little one? What
is your name?'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'I am the daughter of Etienne Poulinet,
Mayor of Maillane,' she replied. 'My name is
Délaïde.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'What!' said my father, 'the daughter of
Poulinet, Mayor of Maillane, coming out to
glean!'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Master,' she replied, 'we are a large family,
six girls and two boys, and our father, although
he is fairly well-off, when we ask him for pin-money,
says, "My dears, if you want money to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
make yourselves smart go and earn it." So that
is why I have come to glean.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"Six months after this meeting, which reminds
one of the old story of Ruth and Boaz the gallant
yeoman asked Master Poulinet for his daughter,
and I was born of this marriage.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Well, then, my arrival in the world having
taken place on September 8, 1830, in the afternoon,
the happy mother sent for my father, who
was at that time, as usual, in his fields.</p>

<p class="pbq">"As soon as the running messenger came within
hearing, he called out: 'Come, master, for the
mistress has just been delivered.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'How many?' asked my father.</p>

<p class="pbq">"'One&mdash;a fine boy.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'A son! May the bon Dieu make him strong
and wise!'</p>

<p class="pbq">"And without more, as if nothing had happened,
the good man finished his work and returned
deliberately to the farm. This showed no
lack of tenderness, but, brought up, and indoctrinated,
like the old Provençals, in the Roman
tradition, his manner showed the surface roughness
of the ancient <i>pater familias</i>."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The child narrowly escaped being christened
Nostradamus, but was called Frédéric instead, in
memory of a poor little urchin who had carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
love-letters between Mistral's parents during
their courtship and had died shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>His childhood was spent in soaking in the details
of the large simple life in and about his
home, and all the lore of the past that was stored
up by the country people. He went to the University
of Avignon, and to Aix to study law, and
there gradually formed in him the purpose to
devote his life to the literary revival of the national
tongue, which had sunk from its proud estate
as a language of high poetry to little more than
a peasant dialect. He was not alone in his love
for it. Other names were honoured throughout
Provence of the joyous, high-mettled band that
formed themselves into a society to advance their
object, and made such an immense pleasure of
their lives as they worked towards their end.
There were sweet singers among them&mdash;Aubanel,
Roumanille, Félix Gras, and others&mdash;although
none whose names will live as Mistral's will; for
he long outlived them all, and his fame has spread
everywhere. They called themselves the "Félibres,"
and their movement the "Félibrige," using
a word that Mistral had found in an old legend
to designate the seven Doctors of the Law with
whom Christ disputed in the Temple; and no one
who has visited Provence needs telling how much
alive the movement is. Besides his poems, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
some charming stories, Mistral has produced an
exhaustive Dictionary of the Provençal language,
and if his fame had not been established half a
century ago on the publication of "Mireille," his
museum at Arles, in which he sought to gather
up all the story of Provençal life, so that what
has passed or is passing away should never be
forgotten, would keep his memory green. It is
a noble gift in itself, this museum housed in one
of the ancient buildings of Arles. In 1906 Mistral
was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature,
and dedicated it to this purpose. He wanted nothing
for himself that money could buy. For
eighty-four years he lived among his own people
the common life of the land, and came to be
supremely honoured by them all. They called
him the Emperor of the South; there was no one
whose name carried more weight.</p>

<p>For the gift that he brought to his people,
his grand old father of whom he draws such a
delightful portrait in his Memoirs, must be accorded
some of the thanks. As in the case of
Ruskin and of Browning, a parent who had no
connection with literature himself fostered the
early studies of the son and left him to follow
his bent, while relieving him of the necessities
which often smother talent, though never perhaps
genius. But then Mistral's father was himself
an inspiration to the work his son set himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
do when he returned to the large liberty of his
home.</p>

<p>"The Judge's farm was at this time a true
home of pure poetry, biblical and idyllic. Did
it not live and sing around me, this poem of
Provence with its blue depths framed by the
Alpilles? One had only to go out to be dazzled
by it. Did I not see Mireille passing, not only
in my young dreams, but even in person, sometimes
in one of those pretty young girls of Maillane,
who came to pick mulberry leaves for their
silkworms, sometimes in the grace of those who
came and went with bare throats and white coifs
among the corn and the hay, in the olive-gardens
and among the vines?</p>

<p>"Did not the actors in my drama, the labourers,
harvesters, herdsmen and shepherds, come and
go before my eyes from dawn till dusk? Could
you have a finer old man, more patriarchal, more
worthy to be the prototype of my Master Ramon,
than old François Mistral, whom no one, not even
my mother, ever called anything but the Master?
My poor father&mdash;sometimes when the work was
pressing and he wanted help, either to get in the
hay or to draw up the water from the well, he
would call out: 'Where is Frédéric?' Although
at that moment I might be stretched under a willow
idly pursuing some fugitive rhyme, my dear
mother would reply: 'He is writing.' And immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the rough voice of the good man would
soften as he said: 'Don't disturb him.' For to
him, who had never read anything in his youth
but the Bible and Don Quixote, writing was almost
a holy office."</p>

<p class="b1">As a young man Mistral's father had been
requisitioned to carry corn to Paris during the
Reign of Terror, and was struck with horror
at the execution of the king.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p class="pbq">"He was profoundly religious. Every evening,
summer as well as winter, kneeling at his
chair, head uncovered, hands to his forehead, with
his hair in a queue tied by a silk ribbon, he would
pray for us aloud; and when the evenings lengthened
in the autumn he would read the Gospels
to his children and his servants....</p>

<p class="pbq">"Although he would pick up a fagot on the
road and carry it home; although he would content
himself for his ordinary fare with vegetables and
brown bread; although, in the midst of plenty,
he was always abstemious, and would mix water
with his wine, yet his table was always open, as
well as his hand and his purse, to any poor
wayfarer. Then, if there was talk of any one,
he would ask first: 'Is he a good worker?' and
if the answer was, yes, he would say: 'Ah, he's
a good man; I'm his friend.'"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This charming book of Mistral's and his
poems, give more of flavour of Provence than
anything I have read, and the link between our
times and his was not even snapped by his death
on the day I walked through the country that
he more particularly wrote of.</p>

<p>He was never for long away from Provence
during the eighty-four years of life, but was much
lionized when he did venture as far as Paris.
I very much wish that I had seen him, for his
personality counted for a great deal in the movement
he spent his life in fostering, and he was
the last survivor of the original Félibres. It
now remains to be seen whether the revival will
continue of itself. I have heard it compared with
other national revivals, fostered by intellectuals,
but taking no great hold of the people, and
prophecies of its decay. But I think it has life
in it. Mistral would certainly not have called
himself an intellectual, and he never behaved like
one. He was one of the people himself, and they
are fortunate to have found such an interpreter.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Saint-Remy</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">On the way up from Les Baux to the <i>col</i>, and
for some distance beyond, the country is arid and
cold; but the wealth of aromatic and flowering
shrubs that carpet the ground in these stony
regions, and the breathing spirit of the spring,
gives them a charm of their own that is far
removed from desolation. The road was lonely
enough. A few flocks of sheep and goats clattered
among the loose stones of the hillsides that
were on either side, among the pines and the
thyme and rosemary and the yellow brooms; and
the shepherds watched and whistled to them,
never very far away. A motor-car passed me as
I rested at the top of the hill, and a carriage
jogging along the straight road to the "plateau
des antiquités" offered itself for a lift; for I was
on my way to see something that every tourist
in these parts comes to see, and this one was
plying for hire in this lonely region in the ordinary
way of business. But otherwise I had the
road to myself in the early morning, and took
my time over the six or seven kilometres that were
all that I was yet able to accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The two noble monuments that stand in an
open space a mile or so to the south of Saint-Remy,
and dominate the wide expanse on all
sides, can be seen long before one reaches them,
from the south. The wildness of the hills has
begun to give place to cultivation, but they stand
by themselves with no other buildings near them,
reminders of a story that has never been forgotten
by the poorest and least educated of those
who work within sight of them.</p>

<p>The so-called mausoleum is the older of the
two. It has an inscription that has caused considerable
difficulties to the antiquarians. I need
not go into the controversy, but will accept the
conclusions set forth by Mr. Cook, who deals
with the question in his own lucid and convincing
way.</p>

<p>The inscription is to the effect that Sextus,
Lucius, and Marcus, Julii, and sons of Caius,
dedicated this monument to their parents; and
within the colonnade on the top of it are two
statues which have been supposed to represent
these objects of filial piety. But the inscription
is not less than a hundred years later than the
date of the monument on which it was carved,
and the probability is that some rich colonials
"calmly appropriated a fine 'antiquity,' wrote
their own names on it, and buried the respected
corpses of their parents within a building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
originally intended for entirely different
uses."</p>

<p>The bas-reliefs on the four sides of the base
represent a Roman triumph, and there seems
little doubt that this noble monument was erected
to commemorate the great victory of Caius Marius
over the barbarians, on the spot where he had
first met them. It was erected by Julius Cæsar,
the nephew of Marius, and the two figures represent
the great general himself, and Catullus, his
colleague in the consulship, when their combined
forces crushed the Cimbrians upon the Raudine
Plain.</p>

<p>The Triumphal Arch, which stands close to
the monument, was also erected by Julius Cæsar,
to celebrate his great victory over Vercingetorix.
It is the earliest Roman triumphal arch outside
Italy, and there are probably only two in Rome
that are earlier.</p>

<p class="p1">The photographs will show the wonderful state
of preservation of the monument, as well as its
beautiful details. The arch also preserves much
of its detail, and the two monuments together
have a striking effect. Mr. Cook draws a just
comparison between these sane and beautiful relics
of classical antiquity and the misery and squalor
of the mediæval ruins of Les Baux. It is a comparison
that strikes one forcibly throughout Provence.
We shall see other examples of Roman
architecture&mdash;in the Pont du Gard, the Arenas
at Nîmes and Arles, and elsewhere&mdash;and in comparison
with them all but fragments of the oldest
churches and palaces and fortifications that came
after them are things of yesterday. And yet the
Roman works seem to be built to stand for ever,
and tell their tale so that all may read it; while
with the buildings of centuries after, the tale is
confused often beyond unravelment. We know
of the history that led to the erection of these
"antiquities" at Saint-Remy, and the men who
made them, almost as if they were things of a
generation ago. Move forward a thousand years
and the long history of Les Baux was just beginning.
Its princes crept out of obscurity, and
its stately buildings arose, to arrive at splendour
through long centuries, to decay and to lie in
ruins for centuries more; and all the time these
other buildings within a few miles of them, whose
life has been twice as long as theirs in all their
phases, have continued almost in their first perfection.
And you must move on for much more
than a thousand years before you find the Christian
legends that derived from the people and
events which these monuments commemorated
firmly fixed in the minds of men, and giving rise
to the beautiful buildings which now vie with
those of the Romans in interest. In this country,
one is not allowed to forget how many hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of years it took for the church to produce its
fine flowers of architecture, when one is continually
coming across those of a civilization that was
old before the Church ever existed.</p>

<p>Not far from these Roman "antiquities" is
an interesting church and cloister of the twelfth
century, but I did not turn aside to see it, as
walking had now become a painful business, and
it took me half an hour to limp down the long
avenue that led to the pleasant town of Saint-Remy.
It is a gay, clean little town, its broad
streets and squares shaded by great limes and
planes and chestnuts, its gardens full of flowering
shrubs, and rich with beds of colour. One seems
to have got back to the country about Grasse,
but here the flowers are grown for seed, not for
scent. Saint-Remy's chief industry is the production
of seeds for the horticulturists. I should
have liked to see something of it, but had to content
myself with sitting still until the departure
of the omnibus for Avignon.</p>

<p>This was a great clumsy petrol-driven conveyance
in which the men stood in one compartment,
holding on to anything within reach as it lurched
and swayed along the road, and the women sat
in another. I think it was market-day. At any
rate the seated compartment was full of peasant
women nursing their baskets, every window closed
and the heat considerable. I might have borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that for the sake of a seat, of which there was
one vacant, but when I opened the glass door
between the compartments I was met with such
a powerful efflux of garlic that I closed it again
hurriedly and swayed and lurched with the rest
until we reached Châteaurenard.</p>

<p>It was a charming, fertile country that we
passed through, with one farm succeeding another&mdash;comfortable-looking,
rambling, stone-built
houses and outbuildings, shielded from the fierce
winds by rows of tall cypresses, and even the
fields and market-gardens fenced in with dried
reeds. The <i>mistral</i> and the <i>bise</i>, when they really
set to work, are a scourge. But as old François
Mistral used to say when he heard grumbling
about the weather: "Good people, there is One
above who knows what He is about, and what
is good for us. Supposing those great winds
which bring life to Provence never blew, how
would the mists and fogs of our marshes be
dispersed? And if we never had the heavy rains,
how would our wells and springs and rivers be
fed? We need all sorts, my children."</p>

<p>At Châteaurenard we changed omnibuses for
the five miles' journey to Avignon. They were
mostly townspeople now who crowded the compartments.
There was a family in the corner of
mine&mdash;a mother with three handsome daughters
who crocheted or knitted busily during the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
journey, and a father who sat silent and looked
learned, but amiable. Perhaps he was a <i>félibre</i>;
they are mostly learned and amiable; and Avignon
is one of their chief centres.</p>

<p>We crossed the Durance, a broad and mighty
river, soon to join its waters with those of the
Rhône. The sun was setting over it, and the
knitting ladies laid down their wool and exclaimed
at the beauty of the scene. After another mile
or so we were set down just outside the ramparts
of the ancient city.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Avignon</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Some one had told me that he had stayed at
Avignon for a night while motoring down to the
Riviera early in March, and had seen the Rhône
under a full moon from the garden of the Popes'
Palace, while the nightingales sang among the
trees all around him. This information had been
presented to me amidst the dreary days of clouds
and thawing snow which come with the end of
winter in the Swiss Alps, and the contrast was
so entrancing that I had half a mind to make
straight for Avignon first of all, by train. I had
seen that beautiful garden, and the grand view
from its terraces, with the Rhône rolling its
mighty stream down below; the fabled bridge of
St. Bénézet still throwing a few arches across
it, with its two-storied chapel at the end of
them; the forts and towers of Villeneuve a mile
away on the other side; and the distant mountains
closing in the great expanse of fruitful country.
It was a spot to dream of and to long for.</p>

<p>But I think there must have been a mistake
about the nightingales; or at least about the
month. It was now the twenty-fourth of March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and, although the trees were beginning to break
into leaf at last, I heard no nightingales in Provence.</p>

<p>Avignon has a famous inn&mdash;the Hôtel de l'Europe&mdash;very
old, very picturesque, with its archway
and flower-grown court. Indeed, it is so much in
keeping with all the rest that a stay there serves to
heighten the pleasant memories that every visitor
must carry away with him of the fascinating
city. But on this journey I was on the lookout
for something more retiring; and by good fortune
I found something as good of its kind as I have
ever happened upon.</p>

<p>I walked up the broad Rue de la République,
with its gay and busy shops, <i>cafés</i> and picture
palaces, its trams, plane-trees, soldiers and citizens,
and all the life and appearance of a modern
street, and came to the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville.
On either side of this main artery lies the old
Avignon, and I knew that I only had to turn
aside from it to lose that somewhat disconcerting
note of modernity, and perhaps to find my ideal
<i>auberge</i>. I found it just off the <i>place</i>, very ordinary
outside, and indeed in, but with a host and
hostess whose sole aim seemed to be the welfare
of their guests, and with cooking that would make
the fortune of one of those Soho restaurants that
the world occasionally discovers and flocks to for
a time. Good wine, too, and all at a price that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
makes one wonder how these things are done.
Find it for yourselves, ye travellers who want to
save your pockets, and are content with a clean
bed, good fare and a kindly welcome; commend
me to madame, and ask her to give you a dish
of <i>bouillabaisse</i>.</p>

<p>I went up that evening, past the huge looming
mass of the Popes' Palace and the cathedral to
that delightful garden, with its dark foliage,
gleaming sheets of water, statues and balustrades,
and looked out over the Rhône and the dim country
beyond. It is one of those places in which
the past of a very old city seems to concentrate
its memories. Whatever one knows of its history
comes before one, half real; whatever is
left of the city itself that is part of its history
takes on its old meaning, and whatever is new is
forgotten. In this corner of Avignon, the buildings
round the great oblong of the Place du Palais,
the ancient streets just off it, the huge rocks
that lift it high in the air, the ramparts and
towers and forts below, the cottages and quays
along the river, the half-ruined bridge&mdash;all are
of the old storied Avignon, and only the garden
itself is new, though its newness takes off none
of the effect of its surroundings.</p>

<p>The site of this garden was in papal times a
barren windswept waste, with windmills and
forts, and a cemetery used when Avignon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
isolated by floods. When the Rue de la République
was cut right through the city, the débris
was carted up here and mixed with soil from the
river banks, and this delightful garden laid out.
Shortly after the Crimean war Marshal Canrobert
planted an oak among the ilexes and cedars and
cypresses that mix their dark foliage with the living
green of the deciduous trees, and dedicated
the garden to the use of the citizens of Avignon.</p>

<p>It is a charming spot at all times. I found
myself continually wandering up there, in the
intervals of more serious sight-seeing, or in the
early morning before sight-seeing began, or in
the evening when it was over. Sight-seeing is
really the bane of all beautiful places; one wants
to see everything and is glad one has done so
afterwards, but the way to enjoy a place is to
live one's own life in it, for however short a
time, and take the sights as they come. Unfortunately
they do not come quickly enough when
one has only a day or two to spare for a place
that is full of them, and the only way is to make
a business of sight-seeing, with whatever intervals
of peace one can afford.</p>

<p>I did my duty the next day in spite of the
rain that fell intermittently. In retrospect there
are churches; crooked mediæval streets with little
shrines in niches of the walls; broader Renaissance
streets with handsome buildings; the immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ring of rampart, too big to make any single impression,
but effective enough here and there
when one found oneself at the edge of the city;
the busy modern boulevards, which after a time
fail to take away from the impression of the whole
as a very ancient and very picturesque city; and
the mighty palace so dominating everything that
one is hardly ever able to forget it, however far
one's wanderings take one.</p>

<p>I think St. Agricol was the first church I visited.
It is of the fourteenth century, on a very
much older foundation, simple and pleasing, with
a late Renaissance memorial chapel, richly and
gracefully decorated, and containing some beautiful
statuary. Avignon employed many sculptors
of note in the days of its wealth and fame, and
their work is to be found here and there, sometimes
outside of a church and sometimes inside.
One learns to look out for it, and gains many a
little thrill of pleasure in spotting something true
and right and beautiful, among a good deal that
is commonplace. The same may be said of the
paintings of which the churches are full, but both
buildings and pictures are apt to be dark, and
without a great deal of trouble it is difficult to
pick out the good from the ordinary. Probably
the best are in the Musée, and some of those are
so fine that one is content to enjoy thoroughly a
few, and let the rest go by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Agricol was rather busy on the morning I
visited it. In one of the side chapels a number
of small boys were awaiting their turn at the
confessional box. They sat on wooden benches,
their bare legs dangling, and occupied themselves
as is usual with small boys on their best behaviour,
not making too much noise and ready
to be diverted by anything in the shape of novelty
that came their way. When I came unexpectedly
upon them they showed great interest
in me, but the opportunities for comment that I
afforded were immediately displaced by something
much more worthy of attention. The great west
doors were opened and a coffin was carried in
and laid in the chancel. There was a muttered
service lasting a very few minutes, and silverheaded
<i>aspersoirs</i> were handed from one to the
other of the scant body of mourners. Then the
untidy-looking men with their cloth caps on their
heads lifted up the coffin and almost ran with it
down the church, led by a cocked-hatted functionary
whose aim seemed to be to get the whole
business over as quickly as possible. It was the
briskest funeral I have ever seen.</p>

<p>After that, the church rapidly filled up with
crowds of children, and the small boys from the
side chapel, relieved of their burdens of sin, clattered
in to join the rest. A handsome, cheerful-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
priest mounted the pulpit and began to
address them and ask them questions. He very
soon had them interested, and the church rang
with their eager answers and not infrequent laughter,
as he cleverly led them from one point to
another, and caught and threw back every word
that he drew from them. Just as I was going
out of the church a mischievous urchin poked his
head in at another door and shouted something
opprobrious, then ran away as fast as his legs
would carry him. The priest was as ready for
this interruption as he had been for the calls of
his flock. He said something too quickly for me
to catch, and the whole churchful of children
shouted their applause.</p>

<p>More beautiful than St. Agricol is the church
of St. Pierre. Its fine Gothic front, completed
early in the sixteenth century, shows a wealth of
delicate carving, and it fronts a picturesque <i>place</i>
which enables one to get its full effect. The
façade is worth examining in detail, with the luxuriant
carving, round the portal, of vines and
oak leaves and acorns and little figures engaged
in all sorts of agricultural pursuits. I did not
see the carved sixteenth century doors, which are
protected in the same way as those of the cathedral
at Aix, but in a niche between them is a
lifelike eighteenth century statue of the Virgin
and Child&mdash;the Mother, tender and matronly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
bending forward and holding up her flowing
drapery&mdash;which is well worth noting. Very attractive
is the little plane-shaded <i>Place du Cloître</i>,
approached under an archway to the north of
the church. The old ecclesiastical buildings have
been taken possession of by all and sundry, and
are alive with the signs of modern habitation&mdash;clothes
fluttering, gay pot-flowers in windows of
old grey stone, children playing under the trees.
But it is a sweet and peaceful spot in the midst
of a busy city, and its cloistered charm still hangs
to it.</p>

<p>I visited this church several times during the
days I found myself in Avignon, between journeys.
It has the same sort of interest as the
churches one goes in and out of in Italy, though
to a less degree than the finest of them&mdash;a sense
of perfection in the whole, and a good deal that
is worth looking at in detail. There is a lovely
little Gothic pulpit of white stone, with statues
of apostles and saints under delicately carved canopies;
richly carved and gilded woodwork in the
choir, which frames a series of dark but decorative
pictures; a Renaissance altar-piece with a relief
of the Last Supper; some really fine pictures
by the best-known artists of Avignon&mdash;Nicholas
Mignard, Simon de Châlons, Pierre Parrocel, and
others. But the most human and pathetic possessions
of this church are the cardinal's hat and
tunic of St. Pierre de Luxembourg hung up in
a glass case in one of the side chapels.</p>

<p class="p1">This infant phenomenon of the Church had
won fame in Paris for his learning and piety at
the age of nine. At fourteen, already a bishop,
he was made a cardinal, and summoned to the
papal court at Avignon by Clement VII, in order
that his fame might convert the Urbanists to the
Clementine obedience. His reputation spread
throughout Christendom, and was enhanced by
the stories of his extraordinary self-disciplines.
The poor child caused himself to be scourged
as he was lying on his deathbed, and gave orders
that he was to be buried in the common cemetery
of the poor. His shroud and vestments were
torn to shreds, and even the bier broken into fragments
for relics, and countless miracles were
wrought by the touch of his body and afterwards
at his grave. Three thousand of these were attested
by the papal commissioners, not of the
common sort, it was explained, such as "recovery
from fevers and such trivial ills, but the blind
were given sight, the deaf heard, the dumb spake,
and, what is more, the dead were raised to life."</p>

<p>This boy-bishop was canonized a hundred and
fifty years after his death. Now he is forgotten,
and his relics hang there dusty and neglected.
Baedeker does not even mention them, though
Joanne does. There are none of the signs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
devotion and remembrance that are shown to
saints of popular memory, no candles or other
offerings. The Church itself seems to have forgotten
him. Has the efficacy of his self-tortured
life died out, or is there still virtue in these relics
of his princedom, which is there for any one to
whom it may occur to draw on it?</p>

<p>In the rather dark church of St. Didier is a
notable work of art formerly known as the <i>Image
du Roi René</i>, for whom it was executed. It is
a relief in marble representing Christ bearing the
Cross, with a figure of the Virgin on her knees
in the foreground, and a score or so of other
figures, with an architectural background. Its
realism is striking, and rather painful, but it
should not be missed, for it is one of the earliest
sculptures of the Renaissance to be seen in France.
High up on the wall opposite to the chapel in
which this relief is half hidden is a beautiful
Gothic pulpit, or tribune, which is also worth
notice. Probably it was not used for preaching
from. Mr. Okey in his admirable historical and
descriptive account of Avignon, suggests that it
was built for the exposition of relics.</p>

<p>St. Didier has a fine tower and belfry, which
draw the eye when one looks down upon the
roofs of Avignon from the heights above. There
are not many left now of the two or three
hundred towers that were there before the Revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and of the sixty churches or chapels
there are only eighteen, not all of which are
intact, or used for their original purpose. But
there are many curious "bits" still left in
Avignon, which one continually comes across as
one strolls about the streets&mdash;noble fronts of rich
mansions, carved porches and doorways, innumerable
ancient streets of smaller houses, which have
remained almost untouched, and here and there
a church or a single tower that has escaped destruction
so long that one hopes it will be preserved
for ever.</p>

<p>Avignon, indeed, would be interesting enough
if its great lions were left out; as it is, they
dwarf everything else, and perhaps an apology
is needed for dealing with the parish churches
before the cathedral and the Palace of the Popes.
But before we give ourselves over to the big
things of Avignon, let us finish with the smaller.</p>

<p class="b1">Every one has heard of the Bridge of St.
Bénézet, and the old jingle:</p>

<p class="ppn20"><i>Sur le Pont d'Avignon<br />
L'on y danse l'on y danse,<br />
Sur le Pont d'Avignon<br />
L'on y danse tout en rond.<br />
Les beaux messieurs font Comm' çà,<br />
Et puis encor Comm' çà.<br />
Sur le Pont d'Avignon<br />
L'on y danse tout en rond.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">It was a stupendous work of its time, which
even the Romans seemed to shirk; indeed, so
great that it was necessary to assign it to a
supernatural origin. The story was told by order
of Friar Raymond of the Bridge, and sealed by
the Pontifical Rectors.</p>

<p>When Benet was a young child and was watching
his mother's sheep, the voice of Jesus Christ
came to him ordering him to build a bridge over
the Rhône, which until then he had never heard
of. An angel in the guise of a pilgrim led him
to the place where the bridge was to be built
and telling him to cross the river and show himself
to the bishop and the townspeople of
Avignon, vanished from his sight.</p>

<p>The ferryman was a Jew, and scoffed at his
prayer to be taken over the river for the love
of God and Our Holy Lady Mary, but Little
Benet gave him the three farthings which were
all his worldly wealth, and he ferried him across.</p>

<p>Little Benet interrupted the bishop's sermon
by announcing his mission. He was led to the
provost of the city to be chastised, and announced
it also to him. The provost reviled him but said
that if he could carry away a certain stone which
he had in his palace he would believe that he could
build the bridge. The bishop and all the townspeople
looked on while he raised the stone, which
thirty men could not have moved, as easily as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
if it were a small pebble and carried it away
to form the foundation stone of his bridge.</p>

<p>So, with a gift of money from the repentant
provost, and more from the townsfolk, and with
the usual miracles of healing and raising the dead
to life, the bridge was begun, and Little Benet
hailed as a true saint.</p>

<p>The pretty story, which is given in full, translated
from the Provençal, in Mr. Okey's book
need not be rejected entirely. There <i>was</i> a
Little Benet, as well as a Great, and he was
instrumental in building the bridge. For he was
chief of a community of Friars Hospitallers
founded at Maupas, near Avignon, in 1164, "to
establish ferries, build bridges, and give hospitality
to travellers along the rivers of Provence."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>One of the most attractive exhibitions of religious
feeling in the Middle Ages, among a good
many that are not at all attractive, was this
undertaking of works of necessity by men of piety
who believed that they were doing service to God
by doing service to men. "Travellers were considered
as unfortunates deserving pity," says M.
Jusserand in his "English Wayfaring Life in
the Middle Ages," in which there is much interesting
information about the building and preservation
of roads and bridges, "and help was
given to them to please God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, when Henry VIII gave the lands of
the dissolved monastery of Christ Church to Canterbury
Cathedral, he declared that he made this
donation "in order that charity to the poor, the
reparation of roads and bridges, and other pious
offices of all kinds should multiply and spread
afar." It is probable that the Frères Pontifes,
taking their pattern from the Collegium Pontificum
of Rome, owed their Christian impetus to
St. Benet of Avignon, for his is the first society
of its kind that is known, though it was soon
copied all over Europe. It took him eleven years
to build the bridge, and he also built the chapel of
St. Nicholas that still stands upon it. He was
buried in this chapel, and his body remained there
for five hundred years. But the great floods of
1669 so shook the structure that his remains were
translated to a chapel at the end of the bridge,
thence to the church of the Célestines, and
finally at the Revolution, into the church of St.
Didier.</p>

<p>Is it too fanciful to suppose that there is some
foundation in fact for the legend of his beginning
his great work as a child? I like to imagine him
filled with his great idea as he walked by the
side of the Rhône as a boy, talking about it and
being laughed at, gradually forming a strong purpose,
and finally bringing it to a triumphant
issue. It reminds me of Dickens, as a poor child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
passing the mansion of Gad's Hill and making
up his mind that he would some day live there.</p>

<p>The bridge passed through many vicissitudes.
It was much quarrelled over, and seems to have
been kept in fair repair whenever the Church's
rights in it were recognized, but let go when it
was in the hands of the laity. It has been in
ruins now for two hundred and fifty years, but
the few arches that remain show how well Little
Benet and his bridge-builders did their work; and
as it stands now it is one of the most picturesque
features of the beautiful city.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>The Palace of the Popes</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">"No one who did not see Avignon in the time
of the Popes has seen anything. For gaiety, life,
animation and one fête after the other, there
was never a town like it. From morning till
night there were processions, pilgrimages, streets
strewn with flowers and hung with stuffs, disembarkings
of cardinals from the Rhône, banners
flying, galleys gay with flags, the soldiers of the
Pope singing Latin in the squares, the begging
friars swinging their rattles. And from top to
bottom of the houses that pressed humming round
the great papal palace, like bees round their hive,
there was the <i>tic-tac</i> of the lace-makers' bobbins,
the flying shuttles that wove cloth of gold for
the chasubles, the little hammers of the metal-workers
who made the chalices, the sound-boards
being adjusted by the lute-makers, the songs sung
over the looms; and above it all the pealing of
the bells, and always the beating of tambourines
down by the bridge. For with us, when people
are happy they must dance, they must dance;
and as in those times the streets of the town
were too narrow for the <i>farandole</i>, fifes and tambourines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
posted themselves <i>sur le pont d'Avignon</i>,
in the fresh air of the Rhône, and day and night
<i>l'on y dansait, l'on y dansait</i>.</p>

<p>"Ah, happy time! happy town! Halberds without
an edge; state prisons in which wine was
kept to cool! Never any scarcity; never any fighting!
That was how the Popes of the Comtat
knew how to rule their people; and that is why
their people have missed them so much."</p>

<p class="b1">Thus Alphonse Daudet, a true son of Provence,
draws his picture of papal Avignon, in
that delicious story of his, "La Mule du Pape."
As for the freedom of Avignon from war, during
the seventy years that the Popes had their
seat there, history would hardly justify the people
of Avignon in regretting them on that account;
nor probably were the dungeons of the papal
palace lacking in tenants even at the best of times,
for it was a cruel age, and the pleasures of the
best of Popes would not have been greatly disturbed
by the thought of men rotting in misery
beneath the hall in which he was feasting. But
the experience of all times of strife is that life
goes on side by side with fear and danger, and
merrily enough when the weight is lifted ever
so little. Very likely Daudet's picture of Avignon
enjoying itself is true enough. Clement VI, to
whose time his story would refer, if it were intended
to refer to any particular pontificate, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
not much like the kindly old man who fed his
mule with spiced wine, and advanced the adventurer
who admired her, but neither was he like
what a Pope would have to be nowadays.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Generous and open-handed," writes Mr.
Okey, "a thousand hungry clerics are said to have
crowded into Avignon seeking preferment, none
of whom went empty away; for no suitor should
leave a prince's court, said he, unsatisfied. Exquisitely
polite and courteous, Clement had a gracious
amenity of manner. Accustomed to the
society of noble ladies, his court was crowded
with fair dames and gallant knights; his stables
were filled with beautiful horses; his hospitality
was regal and his table loaded with rich viands
and rare wines. The fair Countess of Turenne,
his constant companion, disposed of benefices and
preferments, and her favour was the surest avenue
to fortune. No sovereign of his time kept
so brilliant and expensive a court, and when one
of the cardinals remonstrated and recalled the examples
of Benedict and John, he replied magnificently:
'Ah! my predecessors never knew how
to be a pope.' Clement relaxed the rigid constitution
of Gregory X, <i>Ubi magis</i>, for the government
of conclaves, made in 1274, and ordered
that the cardinals might have curtains to their
cells, to be drawn when they rested or slept;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
they might have two servants, lay or cleric, as
they pleased, and after the lapse of three days,
in addition to their bread and wine, they might
have fruit, cheese, and an electuary, and one dish
of meat or fish at dinner, and another at supper."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="p1">It was in 1309, for reasons that we need not go
into, that Clement V set up his court at Avignon
in the papal county of Venaissan. "This was a
man," wrote Villani, "most greedy for money
and a simoniac. Every benefice was sold in his
court for money, and he was so lustful that he
openly kept a most beautiful woman, the Countess
of Perigord, for his mistress." But he was also
a great lover of the arts, as is shown by "the
vast treasure of gold and silver vessels, gems,
antiques and manuscripts seized by his nephew
at his death." He died five years later, when there
was an interregnum for two years. Then the
Bishop of Avignon was elected Pope under the
title of John XXII.</p>

<p>He was a small, wiry, learned and subtle old
man of seventy-one, the son of a cobbler, and
he lived to be nearly ninety. The conclave took
place at Lyons, and he is said to have compassed
his election by a promise to the Roman cardinals
that he would not mount horse or mule except
to go to Rome. So he got into a boat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
dropped down the Rhône to Avignon, "entered
the papal palace on foot, and never left it again
save to cross to the cathedral."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>His palace was the old bishop's palace that
stood where the mighty mass of the Pope's Palace
stands now, but the cathedral was the same, although
it has been very much altered.</p>

<p>It stands very nobly, high above the <i>place</i>, and
towering above the palace itself, which it adjoins.
Its square tower is surmounted by a colossal gilt
statue of the Virgin, which was put there in 1859,
and bears that appearance. The cathedral dates
from the eleventh century, but was rebuilt in the
twelfth. The west porch with its Corinthian
architecture was long thought to be of Roman
construction, but it was probably erected rather
later than the first rebuildings, and owes its classical
appearance to the influence that Roman work
had upon the Provençal architects, who had before
them many fine buildings to study. It was
once decorated with frescoes by Simone Memmi,
who was brought to Avignon from Siena in the
fourteenth century and did some beautiful work
there, some of which we shall see later in the
Popes' Palace. His paintings in the cathedral
have unfortunately disappeared, all but a few
fragments, which, however, include a figure in
a green gown, kneeling, which is said to be a
portrait of Petrarch's Laura. Simone did meet
Laura in Avignon and painted her portrait, for
which Petrarch paid him in two sonnets that
"brought more fame to the poor life of Master
Simone," says Vasari, "than all his works have
brought him or will bring."</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The great west doors of the cathedral stand
open, and its floor is wholly bare. It is much
more effective so, but it makes the church look
smaller than it is. Indeed, when you consider
that you are standing in what was, during the
seventy years of the "Babylonian Captivity,"
the first church in Christendom, you must be
struck by its smallness. But the Popes of
Avignon gave most of their attention to their
palace, and not much was done for the cathedral.</p>

<p>The main plan is a high nave, lighted, from
an octagonal lantern in the last bay, and a semi-circular
apse. The chapels came later. So did
the elaborately carved marble gallery and tribunes
on either side of the nave.</p>

<p>One of the two chapels first to be built contains
the remains of the beautiful tomb of Pope
John XXII and his nephew. It has been much
mutilated and much restored. The recumbent
figure is not that of the Pope whose effigy first
lay there, and of the sixty marble statues that
adorned its niches none remain, though it is possible
that one or two of those on the pulpit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
St. Pierre, which we have already seen, may have
been taken from the tomb. It must have been
a glorious monument when it was first erected,
and is even now a thing to see. What is called
the tomb of Benedict XII in another chapel is a
pure "make-up," much of it of the nineteenth
century. There <i>was</i> a beautiful monument to this
great pope, but in the eighteenth century all that
was left of it was moved. It stood in the chapel
of the Tailors' Guild, and they wanted the space
for a monument to a tailor.</p>

<p>The Revolution created great havoc in the
cathedral. The cloisters and chapter-house that
stood to the east of it were swept away, and
all their treasures and those of the cathedral
looted, or else broken up. For some reason the
old papal throne was spared, and stands in the
choir&mdash;a plain chair of white marble, with the
lion of St. Mark and the ox of St. Luke carved
upon it.</p>

<p>It was John XXII who really fixed upon
Avignon as the papal city&mdash;Clement V had
thought of transferring his seat to Bordeaux&mdash;and
he soon set about housing himself in a manner
worthy of a pope. He bought land, and
began to build splendidly, not only a palace for
himself, but one for his nephew, who had been
presented with the bishopric. It still stands on
the north side of the <i>place</i>, a comfortable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
roomy house enough, though nothing beside the
vast pile upon which it looks. He also built
himself splendid country houses, one of them
at Châteauneuf, where were the famous papal
vineyards, and from which still comes a famous
wine.</p>

<p class="b1">Experts have pointed out some traces of Pope
John's work, as well as of the small palace which
he replaced; but the great fortified pile in which
these were incorporated dates from the next reign&mdash;that
of Benedict XII. The necessity there was
for building a fortress is rather curious. Pope
John had amassed a treasure so vast that his successor
had to take exceptional steps to guard it.</p>

<p class="pbq">"According to Villani&mdash;who makes the statement
on the authority of his brother, who was
the representative at Avignon of the great Florentine
banking house of the Bardi, of which they
were members&mdash;eighteen millions of gold florins
were found in the papal treasury at John's death;
and gold and silver vessels, crosses, mitres, jewels
and precious stones to the value of seven millions
more. And this prodigious wealth, adds the historian,
was amassed by his industry and sagacity
and the system of the reservation of all the collegiate
benefices in Christendom on the plea of
preventing simony."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Mr. Okey goes into an elaborate and interesting
discussion as to the present-day value of this
vast sum, and puts "the approximate value of
the papal treasure at John's death, according to
Villani's statement, at the incredible figure of one
hundred million pounds sterling." No wonder
the walls of the palace were built to stand!</p>

<p>Benedict XII was the third French Pope, and
in spite of remonstrances decided to stay on at
Avignon. Indeed, Rome was impossible at this
time. Civil strife raged there; and "so neglected
and ruinous and overgrown with weeds were the
churches, that cattle browsed up to the altars
in St. Peter's and the Lateran, and a papal legate
offered the marbles of the Coliseum for lime-burning."</p>

<p>Sometimes, in all that welter of crime and
piety, squalor and luxury, cruelty and sentiment,
of the Middle Ages, there stands out the figure
of a man whom we seem to recognize as something
nearer to ourselves than most of them. Our
religion&mdash;even the religion of Catholic countries&mdash;is
so different in spirit from the religion of
those days that it is difficult to account for the
actions of one after another of the great churchmen,
except under the supposition that they were
a set of greedy, bloodthirsty hypocrites, which
probably most of them were not. But through it
all there were constantly arising men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
who were actuated by much the same ideas as we
should recognize as holy and righteous if we contemplated
them in a living person. The greatest
of these saints, we know, helped to fix the standard
of goodness that is generally held today.
They were men and women of genius, and we
understand them as well as they were understood
in their own day or perhaps better.</p>

<p>But it is something a good deal less than genius
that brings that sense of recognition in the case
of a character like that of Benedict XII. He was
a large, red-faced man, who was said by his detractors
to love coarse jokes and to drink heavily;
but his detractors were the clergy from whom he
insisted upon behaviour much more in accordance
with modern ideas than with those of his own
age, and they could not forgive him. "He was
a man," wrote one of them, "hard, obstinate, avaricious;
he loved the good overmuch, and hated
the bad; he was remiss in granting favours, and
negligent in providing for the services of the
church; more addicted to unseemly jests than to
honest conversation; he was a mighty toper, and
'<i>Bibamus papaliter</i>&mdash;let us drink like a pope'&mdash;became
a proverb of the day."</p>

<p>The indictment contains more than a touch
of spite. It is not to be supposed that a man
who drank mightily, if he really did so, or laughed
at a broad story, would have been thought deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of much censure in those days, especially
by one who felt no incongruity in accusing him
of loving the good overmuch or setting his face
against nepotism. Those were virtues that were
hated in that society, so crooked in its views that
it could even brand them openly as faults without
fear of reproach.</p>

<p>This bluff, honest man built the greater part
of the palace, "which," wrote one of his chroniclers,
"with its walls and towers of immense
strength stands like himself, four-square and
mighty." About half as much again, however,
was added in later pontificates, and Benedict's
building was a good deal altered; but the four
great fortified towers are his, and the buildings
in between, which include his chapel. These are
used now for the storing of archives, and other
similar purposes, and are not shown to the public,
but one or two of the towers can be ascended
and magnificent views obtained from them.</p>

<p>Of the massive walls little has been destroyed
either by time or by the many vicissitudes through
which the great building has passed. Of all the
architecture that one sees in this country the
Popes' Palace is the most like those huge, enduring,
almost brutally strong, buildings that the
Romans left behind them. An ineffaceable impression
is gained of it as one walks up the narrow,
winding Rue de la Peyrolie which leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
from the lower parts of the town on the east to
the Place du Palais. Part of the street has been
cut out of the naked rock, and far overhead
towers the south wall of the building, looking
no less solid and permanent than the rock itself.
It is like a gigantic cliff rearing its bulk above
one, and that impression as of something vaster
and stronger than mere human building is never
quite absent from the whole mass, on whatever
point of view it obtrudes itself.</p>

<p>The enormous Court of Honour, which is the
first thing you see after passing in, is undergoing
repair, as, fortunately, is the whole of the building.
It badly needed it, for until seven or eight
years ago the greater part of the palace was used
as a military barracks, and not only was the noble
Hall of Justice divided up into three floors, and
other parts ruthlessly adapted, but great Gothic
windows were destroyed to give place to commonplace
square openings, and in fact no beauty was
spared where it might interfere with convenience.
The restoration has been in hand for over seven
years and is expected to take about as long again
before the palace is put back into something like
its original state. The work is being done with
the utmost care, as all such things are done in
France, but in many details the damage done has
been irreparable.</p>

<p>The great <i>Salle du Conclave</i> has been cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of its rubbish and the tall Gothic windows restored.
It is huge and bare. There are no more than
the worn remains of the frescoes with which
Clement VI caused its walls to be covered, either
by Simone Memmi himself, or by some one of
his school. Some effort was made nearly a hundred
years ago to induce the military authorities
to look after their preservation; but "the Commandant
of the Engineers replied that he did
not share the commissioners' views with regard
to the frescoes; they were of little artistic interest
and not worth preserving; in fact they were not
consonant with the spirit of a military establishment."</p>

<p>It was in this hall that Queen Joan of Naples
defended herself from the charge of being privy
to the murder of her first husband, and won the
day by her eloquence and beauty. Avignon was
hers, and she sold it for 80,000 golden florins
to Clement VI, who thus made an excellent bargain
for the papacy.</p>

<p>By a broad staircase one mounts to the fine
doorway leading to the "new" chapel. It contains
two doors, and the part on the left has been
barbarously mutilated, but the whole is now carefully
restored, as well as the beautiful chapel
itself.</p>

<p>You pass through numerous chambers and
corridors, some of them restored to what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
were, others in the hands of the work-people,
and some still showing the hideous wreck that
the adaptations to military use made everywhere
of the interior of the palace. There is a room
with charming fourteenth century frescoes of
country scenes as pleasant as anything of the
sort I know of. There is a garden with a fish
pond and people preparing to take the disturbed-looking
fish out of it; nymphs bathing; boys getting
fruit from a tree; sportsmen rabbiting with
ferrets; others hunting with falcons. The walls
are covered with a realistic and most decorative
groundwork of foliage and grass, in which you
can pick out all sorts of trees, flowers, fruits,
birds and little animals. Fortunately the greater
part of these delightful paintings are intact, and
a great deal of skill has been shown in restoring
them to something of their pristine state.</p>

<p class="b1">The more famous frescoes of Simone Memmi
in the chapel of St. John the Baptist, and those
of Matteo di Viterbo in that of St. Martial above
it have not escaped so well.</p>

<p class="pbq">"In 1816 a Corsican regiment being quartered
in the Palace, some of the soldiers (who as Italians
knew the value to collectors of the St. Jean
frescoes) began the exploitation of the neglected
chapel and established a lucrative industry in
the corps. Special tools were fashioned for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
work; the men became experts in the art of
detaching the thin layer of plaster whereon the
heads were painted, which they sold to amateurs
and dealers."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p class="p1">So in these beautiful New Testament scenes
which cover roof and walls there are many unsightly
white patches which sadly lessen the effect
of the whole. But I cannot help thinking that
the soldiers must have been stopped in their depredations,
for very much more is left than has
been taken away.</p>

<p>I forget in which of these two chapels it was
that I noticed on a patch of white wall names
scribbled, with dates, quite in the modern tourist's
fashion, and as fresh as if they had been
written yesterday. But the script was "German,"
and the dates of three hundred or so years ago.
So little do habits change!</p>

<p>The rest of the palace that one is allowed to
see has left no very definite impression on my
mind, except that of vast space, and, where it has
not yet been cleared of its barrack adaptations,
of miserable degradation. One sees the funnel
chimney in the middle of the great kitchen which
was for so long said to have been the torture
chamber of the Inquisition; one gets beautiful
views from the higher chambers and windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and from the towers; and here and there one
looks down on to a neglected space that was once
a trim garden.</p>

<p class="b1">If one cannot picture the old popes and cardinals
walking in the beautiful garden from which
we now look down to the Rhône and across to
Villeneuve and the purple country beyond, they
were not without such pleasures, although it never
occurred to any of them to make a garden just
there.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Among the amenities of the old palace were
the spacious and lovely gardens on the east, with
their clipped hedges, avenues of trees, flower-beds
and covered and frescoed walls, all kept fresh and
green by channels of water. John XXII maintained
a menagerie of lions and other wild and
strange beasts; stately peacocks swept proudly
along the green swards,&mdash;for the inventory of
1369 specifies seventeen peacocks, some old and
some young, whereof six are white."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Even when the restoration is finished it will
need a strong effort of imagination to recall the
scenes that were witnessed by these gigantic walls.
They tell of the strength of the place and of the
necessity for that strength. One can imagine the
fighting, but it will all be too much swept and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
garnished to call up the scenes of splendour and
luxury that were piled one upon another even
in times of misery&mdash;of war and of flood and of
plague.</p>

<p class="b1">The luxury was like nothing that we know of
except that of some of the Roman Imperial courts.
Mr. Okey has collected many extraordinary details,
from which I take as an example the account
of the banquet given by two cardinals to
Pope Clement V.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Clement, as he descended from his litter, was
received by his hosts and twenty chaplains, who
conducted him to a chamber hung with richest
tapestries from floor to ceiling; he trod on velvet
carpet of triple pile; his state-bed was draped with
fine crimson velvet, lined with white ermine; the
sheets of silk were embroidered with silver and
gold. The table was served by four papal knights
and twelve squires, who each received silver girdles
and purses filled with gold from the hosts;
fifty cardinals' squires assisted them in serving
the banquet, which consisted of nine courses of
three plates each&mdash;twenty-seven dishes in all. The
meats were built up in fantastic form: castles,
gigantic stags, boars, horses, &amp;c. After the
fourth service, the cardinals offered his holiness
a milk-white steed worth 400 florins; two gold
rings, jewelled with an enormous sapphire and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
no less enormous topaz; and a bowl, worth 100
florins; sixteen cardinal guests and twenty prelates
were given rings and jewels, and twelve young
clerks of the papal house and twenty-four sergeants-at-arms
received purses filled with florins.
After the fifth service, a great tower with a fount
whence gushed forth five sorts of choicest wines
was carried in; and a tourney was run during
the interval between the seventh and eighth
courses. Then followed a concert of sweetest
music, and dessert was furnished by two trees&mdash;one
of silver, bearing rarest fruits of all kinds,
and the other loaded with sugared fruits of many
colours. Various wines were then served, whereupon
the master cooks, with thirty assistants, executed
dances before the guests. Clement, by this
time, having had enough, retired to his chamber,
where, lest he might faint for lack of refreshment
during the night, wine and spices were brought
to him; the entertainment ended with dances and
distractions of many kinds."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The luxury has gone, and so has the terror.
The thick-barred windows of the towers speak
of the many who were immured there in pain and
misery; if the kitchen was not a torture-chamber,
such a chamber was certainly to be found elsewhere;
somewhere on the walls is the hook from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
which was suspended the iron cage in which a
cardinal who had offended the pope was hung
up for months in the sight of all. The times
needed a good deal of gilding.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Vaucluse</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">It was very pleasant to get on to the road again,
with my pack on my back. I was not yet tuned
up to the nearly twenty mile walk between
Avignon and Vaucluse, though my damaged
muscles were now giving me little trouble, so I
took the train to L'Isle-sur-Sorgue, which is distant
from Vaucluse between four and five miles.</p>

<p class="b1">In 1789, Arthur Young made this pilgrimage
to the shrine of Petrarch and Laura, and allowed
himself to be more moved by sentimental interest
than was his custom. L'Isle has changed very
little since that time. It is still the bright, pleasant,
well-watered little town he describes it.</p>

<p class="pbq">"L'Isle is most agreeably situated," he wrote.
"On coming to the verge of it I found fine plantations
of elms, with delicious streams, bubbling
over pebbles on either side; well dressed people
were enjoying the evening at a spot I had conceived
to be only a mountain village. It was a
sort of fairy scene to me. Now, thought I, how
detestable to leave this fine wood and water, and
enter a nasty, beggarly, walled, hot, stinking
town; one of the contrasts most offensive to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
feelings. What an agreeable surprise, to find
the inn without the town, in the midst of the
scenery I had admired! And more, a good and
civil inn. I walked on the banks of this classic
stream for an hour, with the moon gazing on the
waters, that will run for ever in mellifluous poetry:
retired to sup on the most exquisite trout and
crawfish in the world. To-morrow to the famed
origin."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p class="p1">I do not remember the elms, but the planes
were there, as usual, and fine, spreading ones
they were; and what was more, they were beginning
to show a delicate haze of green, which
was very delightful, and what I had been looking
out for ever since I had started on my expedition.
During the two days I had been at Avignon
the spring seemed to have taken that little definite
step forward which makes all the difference. In
the south, where the sun gets hot long before
the trees get green, and so many flowers come
forth to greet it, this longed-for arrival of the
true spring is apt to be discounted, and comes
with less of a thrill than is felt in the north. But
the thrill is there, if one's senses are open to it;
and I felt it on that morning as I walked to
Vaucluse.</p>

<p>"I am delighted with the environs of L'Isle,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Arthur Young wrote of his next morning's ride;
"beautiful roads, well planted, surround and pass
off in different directions, as if from a capital
town, umbrageous enough to form promenades
against a hot sun, and the river splits and divides
into so many streams, and is conducted with so
much attention that it has a delicious effect, especially
to an eye that recognizes all the fertility of
irrigation."</p>

<p class="p2">It is still a fertile, carefully cultivated country,
but gets wilder as one approaches the famous
spring "justly said to be as celebrated almost as
that of Helicon." The river Sorgue, whose
source provides the fountain, is already a full
and rapid stream as one nears the village, and
flows through green meadows down the valley
not far from the winding road. The hills are
high on either side and a great cliff looms in
front of one, closing in the gorge. One's eye
instinctively searches for a cleft down which the
torrent must descend; but none is to be seen&mdash;only
the tall rampart of rock.</p>

<p>The village is pleasant enough, and contains
two inns, each of them quite capable of providing
for a comfortable night's lodging. Too much,
I think, has been written in disgust of the paper-mills,
which use the power of the stream and
provide the village with employment. Their buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
are old enough to make them not so very
incongruous, and they are a small detail beside
the huge masses of rock that enclose the village
on three sides. Nor is either of them in the village
itself. There is an ancient church, an old
stone bridge, gardens and terraces and parapets,
and much shade of trees, and the beautiful sparkling
river that makes music all the time. And
dominating the village on a high crag are the ruins
of the Bishop of Cavaillon's castle, up to which
Petrarch so often climbed to see his friend.</p>

<p>The fountain is some little distance beyond the
village. The road, which runs by the river, passes
one of the factories and then the garden of a
<i>café</i>, where everything was being painted up and
prepared for the coming influx of visitors, and
"La Belle Laure," the motor-boat upon which
trips can be taken on the river, was just about
to be drawn from her winter quarters. With all
this, and with the booths for the sale of picture-postcards
and all sorts of reminiscent rubbish,
most of which has nothing to do with Vaucluse,
or even with Provence, the place has been cockneyfied
enough, and I dare say that if I had
seen it later in the year, or on a Sunday, when
it is crowded with people, I should not have
carried away with me the next morning such an
agreeable impression. But I had it pretty well
to myself, and when I had got past the last of the
booths on to the rocky path above the stream it
was as lonely as it must have been in Petrarch's
time, six hundred years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">But where was the fountain? I had read of
a rocky cave in which it bubbles up, and had
pictured I don't know what in the way of gloom
and mystery. The path led up to the straight,
towering cliff, and there stopped. To my right
was a broad pool of water, and that was all. At
first sight it was just a pool at the foot of the
great rock.</p>

<p>Then I saw that the water was flowing all the
time as it were from the face of the rock itself.
There may have been an inch, but not more, of
the top of the cavern showing. I had found it
at its fullest. Sometimes it sinks so low that the
waters of the pool do not rise to the rocks over
which they were now thundering to the torrent
below, and then the river is fed by an underground
stream, of which the waterfall is only the
overflow.</p>

<p>The pool was very still, and very blue, and
the rocks about it were very bold, but naked and
oppressive. I must confess to having been rather
disappointed; for this is a place in which countless
people have been moved to tears by the beauty
of their surroundings as well as by a sensibility
to the past of which we seem in these prosaic
days to have lost the knack. Mr. Okey tells us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
how in 1783 Alfieri, "on his way to buy horses
in England, turned aside with transport to visit
the magic solitude of Vaucluse, and 'the Sorgue,'
he writes, 'received many of my tears; and not
simulated or imitative tears, but verily hot, scalding,
heartfelt tears.'" Also how Wordsworth,
"on his way to Italy in 1837, was most of all
pleased with the day he spent at Vaucluse, where
he was enchanted with the power and beauty of
the stream and the wildness and grandeur of the
rocks."</p>

<p class="b1">In the eighteenth century the cult of Petrarch
and Laura was very much alive, and no traveller
with any pretensions to taste would have omitted
a visit to the famous fountain if he had found
himself anywhere near. We have already seen
how Arthur Young, who was anything but a
sentimentalist, thought nothing of Avignon except
in connection with the loves of Petrarch and
Laura. The engaging rascal Casanova, who was
a sentimentalist beyond everything, went to
Avignon for no other purpose but to make the
pilgrimage to Vaucluse. Of course he wept
copiously; nothing else was to be expected of
him, and I do not see why Mr. Okey should
take it for granted that his emotion was not genuine.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
He was not the most estimable of characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
but there can be no doubt of his love of
letters, nor indeed of the power of such a story as
that of Petrarch and Laura to touch him. "I
threw myself on the ruins," he tells us, "arms
extended as if to embrace them; I kissed them,
I moistened them with my tears; I sought to
breathe the divine breath which had animated
them." And then he characteristically proceeded
to draw a moral from his emotion that would
help him with the lady to whom he was paying
court at the time.</p>

<p class="pbq">"I asked pardon of Mme. Stuard for having
relinquished her arm to render homage to the
shade of a woman who loved the finest spirit
that the age had produced.</p>

<p class="pbq">"I say spirit; for the flesh, as it seems, was
not concerned in the matter. 'It is four hundred
and fifty years, madame,' said I to the frigid
statue that regarded me with an air of amazement,
'since Laura de Sade walked on the very
spot on which you stand now. It is quite likely
that she was not so beautiful as you are, but she
was gay, bright, sweet, merry and good. May
this air which she breathed, and which you are
breathing at this moment, enliven you with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
divine fire that ran in her veins, that made her
heart beat and her breast palpitate! Then you
will capture the homage of all sensible men, and
you will find none who will dare to cause you
the least annoyance. Gaiety, madam, is the lot
of the happy, and sadness is the dreadful shadow
of spirits condemned to eternal torments. Be
gay then, and thus merit your beauty!'"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p class="p1">It is sad to read that this inspiring address
was received by the lady with no signs of emotion
whatever. She took the chevalier's arm
again and the party returned to the house of
Messer Francesco d'Arezzo, where Casanova spent
a quarter of an hour in carving his name;
after which they dined and went back to
Avignon.</p>

<p>From Casanova's description this scene must
have passed at a house just below Philip de
Cabassole's castle, as he describes himself mounting
to the point of a rock. Such a house was
shown as Petrarch's during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, and one opposite to it, with
an underground passage between the two, was
shown as Laura's. I do not remember either of
these houses, which I believe no longer exist. And
it is pretty certain that none of the places that
were ever celebrated as Petrarch's house was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
really his, though a fair case for the situation of
his dwelling, and the garden he describes with
such affection, has been made out.</p>

<p class="b1">The story of Petrarch's love for Laura, like
that of Dante for Beatrice and Abelard for
Héloïse, has passed into the very texture of literature,
and need not be told here. And it would
be an affectation for one who is unable to read
Italian to pretend to any absorbing interest in
Petrarch's expression of it. I must confess that,
for my own part, I find much more to delight
me in the details of his life at Vaucluse than in
anything that I can gather at second-hand of
his worship of Laura, and those details are real
and fresh enough to give to the place such a
charm as hangs over no other that I visited in
Provence. Mr. Okey has collected them so well
in his chapter "Petrarch at Vaucluse," that I
cannot do better than make a long extract from
his pages.</p>

<p class="pbq">"In 1337 the poet, revolted by the atmosphere
of the papal court, and perhaps a little disappointed
at curial insensibility to his claims for
beneficial favours, turned his back on Avignon
and withdrew to live the simple life near the
source of the Sorgue at Vaucluse, whose romantic
beauty had been impressed on his mind since a
boyish excursion he had made thither in 1316.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
To a modest little house fit for a Cato or a
Fabricius, with no companion but a dog given
him by Cardinal Colonna, living on hard rustic
fare and dressed like a peasant, figs, nuts,
almonds and some fish from the Sorgue his sole
luxuries, the poet retired with his beloved books;
the only sounds that greeted his ears in that
sylvan solitude were the songs of birds, the lowing
of oxen, the bleating of lambs, the murmuring
of the stream. Like Horace, he scorns gold
and gems and ivory and purple; the only female
face he looks upon is that of his stewardess and
servant&mdash;a visage withered and arid as a patch
of the Libyan desert, and such that if Helen had
possessed it, Troy would yet be standing. But
her soul was as white as her body was black,
and her fidelity was imperturbable. By indomitable
industry she was able to attend to the poet's
wants as well as to those of her own household;
faring on hard, dry, black bread, watered wine,
sour as vinegar, she lay on the bare ground, and
would rise with the dawn; in the fiery heat of the
dog-days, when the very grasshoppers are overcome,
her invincible little body would never tire.
Two small gardens the poet had: one a shady
Transalpine Helicon, sacred to Apollo, overlooked
the deep, mysterious, silent pool where the Sorgue
rises, beyond which there was nothing save naked,
barren, precipitous, trackless crags, inhabited only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
by wild animals and birds&mdash;the like of it could
not be found under the sun. The other garden,
better tilled and nearer his house, was bathed by
the crystal waters of the rapid Sorgue, and hard
by, separated by a rustic bridge from his house,
was a grotto whose cool shade and sweet retirement
fostered study; there, in a little retreat,
not unlike the <i>atriolo</i> where Cicero was wont to
declaim, the happy recluse passed the hot afternoons
in meditation; in the cool of the evening
he roamed about the green meadows, and in the
morning rose early to climb the hills. Were not
Italy so far and Avignon so near the poet could
end his days there, fearing nothing so much as
the return to a town.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Dear friends, too, are not lacking. The cultured
Philip of Cabassoles, Bishop of Cavaillon,
dwells in the château that crowns the hill above
his hermitage, and the great ones of the earth
are pleased to seek him in his rustic home. The
island garden of the Sorgue gave incessant
trouble. Writing to Guglielmo di Pastrengo,
the studious recluse recalls the stony patch of
ground his friend helped to clear with his own
hands, and informs him, the once barren waste is
now enamelled with flowers, rebellious nature having
been subdued by human toil. In a charming
epistle, in Latin verse, to Cardinal Colonna,
Petrarch tells of the fierce frontier wars he waged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with the naiads of the Sorgue in order to recover
possession of the garden which he had usurped
from them and which they had reconquered during
his absence in Italy. By dint of strenuous
labour he had cleared a stony patch of land and
planted there a little green meadow, as a retreat
for the Muses. The nymphs, taking it ill that he
should establish strangers in their territory and
prefer nine old maids to a thousand young virgins,
rushed furiously down the mountain to ravage
and destroy his budding garden; he retires
terrified, but, the storm passed, he returns shamefacedly
and restores the desolated land to its
former verdure. Scarce had the sun run his
course when the furious nymphs return, and once
more undo all his labour. Again he prepares
to restore the evicted Muses, but is called away
to foreign parts. After six years he returns to
his solitude: not a vestige remains of his handiwork,
and fish swim at their ease over the site
of his garden. Grief gives him arms, and anger,
strength; he calls to his aid the peasant, the
shepherd, the fisherman; together the allies roll
away great stones and tear out the entrails of
the earth; they chase forth the invading nymphs;
with Ph&oelig;bus's help re-establish the sacred Muses
in their place and build them an abiding temple.
The enemy retires breathing vengeance and awaits
the help of the winter floods and storms; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the victorious champion of the Muses is prepared;
he defends his conquest by a rocky rampart and
defies the fury of the nymphs. Now will he enjoy
a lasting peace and fear no foes; not even
were they allied to the waters of the Po and the
Araxes. His triumph was, however, short-lived,
for we learn from a further letter that with their
allies, the winter floods, the naiads of the spring
gained a final victory, and the defeated Petrarch
was forced to lodge the Muses in another
spot.</p>

<p class="pbq">"The poet always found solace and refreshment
in his gardens. A true lover of horticulture, he
cultivates exotics, experiments on soils and plants,
and writes to Naples for peach and pear trees.
He invites the Archdeacon of Genoa to his dwelling,
happy, celestial and angelic; to the silence
and liberty of his grateful solitude; he will find
secure joy and joyful security, instead of the
noise and strife of cities; he shall listen to the
nocturnal plaints of Philomela, and the turtledove
cooing for her mate.</p>

<p class="pbq">"He bids the convalescent Bishop of Viterbo
find health of body and serenity of mind in the
soft and balmy air of Vaucluse. There in the
warm sun, by the crystal fountain, in umbrageous
woods and green pastures, he shall experience the
delights of Paradise as described by theologians,
or the charms of the Elysian fields as sang by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
poets; a good supply of books and the society of
faithful friends shall not be lacking."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="p1">That is a picture worthy to be put beside those
that one makes for oneself of Horace enjoying
his Sabine retreat, and indeed, if one were to
leave Laura out of consideration, there is an
almost exact parallel in the retirement of the two
poets. If one could have read Petrarch, as one
reads Horace, there would have been a constant
series of little discoveries and recognitions to be
made all about Vaucluse. Even as it was, wandering
about the pleasant quiet place as I did
that afternoon and evening, with the music of
its many waters always in my ears, I gained an
impression that comes back to me now as among
the best that that land of many memories afforded
me. It was only the "fountain" itself in which
I was a little disappointed. The rest was as sylvan
and poetic and peaceful as one would wish
such a place to be, and the shade of the courtly
nature-loving poet seemed to brood over it all,
so little has it changed in essentials.</p>

<p>I made my way up through the olive gardens
to the ruins of the castle, of which there are
enough left to provide a most picturesque feature,
but hardly enough to enable one to picture it as
it was when Petrarch visited his friend there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
One sees the pool and the cliff from it, and the
river running over its stones below, the curious
cave dwellings high up in the rocks opposite, and
the pleasant fertile valley opening out on the
other side. It must have been a delightful country
retreat, and in that remote spot fairly safe
from the disturbances that were apt to centre
round such dwellings, although it was strongly
built and fortified.</p>

<p>The next morning I set out early to walk
back to L'Isle by a roundabout way which took
me over the hills to Saumane, where I had heard
that there was an ancient castle still inhabited.</p>

<p>I found a hill village, very picturesque, as is
the way of such villages in Provence, and walked
round the walls that guarded the château from
the gaze of the vulgar, but found it more inaccessible
to curiosity than is usual with such places.
So I went down again to the village and into the
<i>auberge</i> to refresh myself, and found a friendly
postman also refreshing himself at a table in the
kitchen, who conversed with me on many subjects
but particularly on that of dogs. He seemed to
take an occasional bite as something in the ordinary
way of his rounds, and only showed apprehension
in the case of the dog that bit him being
"malade." I am bound to confess that this possibility
gave me something of a chill. I had seen
the teeth of so many dogs, which seem to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of a particularly unfriendly disposition in that
country, and although I had always managed to
drive them off, my accident at Les Baux had made
me nervous about them. But I had not considered
the chance of hydrophobia, which an Englishman
is apt to forget all about. However, I
suffered nothing further, except an occasional
scare; but whenever I approached a farm and
heard the bark of a dog, I went past very gingerly.</p>

<p>Both the postman and the woman of the inn
gave me to understand that, although the château
was kept strictly closed against unauthorized visitors,
something might possibly be done for me if
I called at a certain cottage with a large rose
over the porch and rattled the coins in my pocket.
Which I did, and was sent up the road hopefully.
On it I met a man leading a donkey laden with
fagots, who promised to join me at the entrance
when he had disposed of his load.</p>

<p>Parts of the château date back to the twelfth
century, but the dull square front is of the seventeenth.
It is magnificently situated on a point
of rock above the village, and commands splendid
views. Or rather, the terraces do, for a grove of
ilexes has been planted all along the front&mdash;I
suppose for shade, and shelter from the wind&mdash;and
nothing can be seen from those windows.</p>

<p>I had exhausted the interest of the gardens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and the immediate surroundings of the château
long before the man with the ass reappeared.
There was an untidy "pièce d'eau" on the sandy
square in front of the house, and some dejected-looking
peacocks in a cage, and over all the rest
was that air of makeshift and economy which
marks so strange a contrast between the châteaux
of France and the lavishly kept-up country houses
of England. Nor was the impression altered
when I was taken inside, as far as the appointments
of the rooms were concerned. I have never
been inside any of the great French provincial
châteaux, but I have seen a good many of the
size of an ordinary English country house, and
never one that was not full of rubbish, or that
had gardens kept up except with the bare minimum
of labour. They have the air of places
to which their owners occasionally retire for a
sort of picnic existence, and I suppose that is
what they are generally used for&mdash;as appanages
to some fine house in a city.</p>

<p>But all the rubbishy furniture and decoration
of this château could not detract from its interest.
It had belonged to the Marquises of Sade.
I do not know whether the infamous eighteenth
century marquis ever owned or lived in it, but
it was the property of the Sades when Petrarch
was at Vaucluse, and even if Laura had not married
into the family, as it is generally supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that she did, Petrarch must have visited it. The
vaulted dining-hall, with its curious echo, can
have changed but little since his time, and one
can say almost with certainty that his feet trod
the stones upon which one stands today, or at
least that he knew the room as one sees it.</p>

<p>The appalling dungeon cells, most of them too
dark and inconvenient to be used now even as
storerooms, show that this castle was equipped
with all the conveniences of the middle ages.
One could more easily imagine a nobleman of
those days doing without his dungeons than a
modern one without his bathrooms or garage. But
the owners of this château seem to have been more
enterprising in making economic use of their
prisoners than most of their fellows. They ran
an illicit mint. There are the stone trough and
table in one of the maze of cells underground.
Nobody could have been indelicate enough to pry
into the domestic arrangements of a gentleman's
dungeons, and the coiners were no doubt as safe
from detection there as anywhere. Nor was it
probable that any of them would give away the
secret. They did not mix with the outside world,
and were not likely to do so again when once
they had been initiated into their new trade.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Nîmes and the Pont du Gard</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">The surpassing charm of Nîmes is provided by
its waters, which are the chief feature of a garden
as beautiful of its kind as is to be seen anywhere.
But these waters were considered too
sacred for common use in Roman times, and in
order to provide this quite unimportant colonial
town, which is not even mentioned by classical
writers, with pure drinking water, an aqueduct
was built to convey to it the waters of the springs
five and twenty miles away; and the remains of
this aqueduct are one of the wonders of the world.
We will take the Pont du Gard first, as I did
on this expedition, walking from Remoulins, and
then back again by the other side of the river,
and on to Nîmes.</p>

<p>It was a bright, hot, spring day, and the first
view I had of the famous aqueduct was through
a haze of foliage which later on would have been
thick enough to hide it until one was almost underneath
its soaring arches. Taking this road to
the left, which is the usual and the shorter one,
the huge structure comes as a sudden surprise;
but I am not sure that it does not provide a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
more interesting sight seen over miles of olive
gardens from the other road.</p>

<p>No detailed description of this mere fragment
of a monumental and enduring work is necessary,
as I am able to give an excellent photograph of
it from a point of view that is not usually taken.
But I doubt if its immensity can be gauged from
any photograph that it is possible to take. It
rises a hundred and eighty feet from the level
of the river. The huge blocks of which it is composed
are put together, and have held together,
without any mortar. It has lasted for close upon
two thousand years, and looks as if it would last
till the end of the world, without much trouble
being taken to keep it in repair. Its effect, indeed,
as one lingers about it, and looks at it
now from the hills above, now from the road
below, now from a distance across the plain,
and tries to get some definite outstanding impression,
is of a work on such a scale that it
rivals that of nature herself. It is huge and yet
it is light; it is regular in design, but irregular
in detail; its use is gone, yet it has life.</p>

<p>It stands in majestic solitude. The blue river
with its sandy bars flows between rocky, wooded
hills, and the white road keeps it company, but
seems to be little used. There is some sort of
a <i>café</i> near it, but it is hidden by the trees. I
had the place all to myself during the hour or
so that I stayed there. The impression of something
belonging to nature more than to the art
of man deepened.</p>

<p class="p1">The photograph, taken from the north bank
of the river, shows the end of the squared channel
which conducted the water, and a little farther
along the roofing with which the whole length of
it was covered. A tall man can walk under it
upright; but if he is inclined to be bulky there
are places where he may have to squeeze himself
through. This is because of the calcareous deposit
left by the water flowing through the channel for
centuries. The thickness and hardness of this
coating must be seen to be believed. At first I
could not imagine how such enormous masses of
what looked like natural rock had been raised to
the summit, and then I remembered reading something
about the deposit, and recognized it for
what it was. Houses have been built of it, and
a whole church in a village not far off.</p>

<p>The jutting-out stones in the middle row of
arches may also be noticed. They were put there
by the Romans probably to provide for scaffolding
when repairs should become necessary.</p>

<p>I do not know why it is that my stay in Nîmes
seems in retrospect rather depressing. The weather
was fine, and what there is to see is well worth
seeing. Perhaps I was getting a little tired of
being alone; perhaps the large, dirty hotel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
which I spent the night had something to do with
it. One puts up with very poor quarters in the
country, and always has some sort of intercourse
with one's fellow-creatures. But in a town it is
different, and I was glad enough to get away
from Nîmes the next morning, bearing with me
nothing very fresh in the way of impressions to
add to those that I had formed of the place
during an hour's visit two years before. In fact,
a motorist who stays to lunch at Nîmes, and sees
the fountains, the arena and the Maison Carée,
may congratulate himself that he has tasted the
full flavour of the brew.</p>

<p>But these three sights, and the "Temple of
Diana," by the fountains, are by all means worth
seeing. Except the Arena, which is somewhat
similar to the one at Arles, there is nothing to
equal them.</p>

<p>The "fountains" are, as to their aspect, seventeenth
century of the happiest. How far they
follow the lines of the Roman baths and washing
pools I have not troubled to enquire, nor does it
very much matter. Probably the semi-circular
basin in which rises the once sacred spring is much
the same as it was in shape. From it the waters
are led underneath pavings and bridges to the
various balustraded and ornamented pools of the
central garden, and then into canals, still of
formal architecture, until they disappear somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
at either end of the long tree-shaded Quai.
It is always fascinating to see water flowing, and
I know nothing more attractive of its sort than
the way this limpid spring comes from under the
dark arches leading to the central pool and covers
a shallow stone floor recessed all the way round
in a colonnade. The photograph gives some idea
of this happy invention, but it is not possible to
convey its pleasing ingenuity. The gardens,
beautifully planted, slope up in a series of bold
staircases and terraces. They show a wealth of
variegated foliage that makes a most pleasing
background to the graceful architecture of the
pools and fountains, and on the lower side broad
avenues of trees lead away from the charming
place quite in the best style of French garden
planning.</p>

<p>In the garden itself are the ruins of a Roman
temple, which has for long been known as the
Temple of Diana. In 1739 an inscription was
found dedicating it to the god Nemausus and the
goddess Diana on behalf of the commonwealth
of Nîmes, and attributing its building to the
munificence of the Emperor Augustus.</p>

<p>Part of the beautiful colonnaded portico has
been reconstructed. It connected the temple with
the Nymphæum, which was where the central
square basin now is. Preserved in the temple
is a single tall pillar&mdash;one of those used to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the <i>velarium</i> under which the Roman ladies
reclined in the course of their bathing.</p>

<p>The architecture of this temple forms a valuable
connecting link between that of the Romans
and of the later Provençal builders, concerning
which Mr. Cook has something interesting to tell
us. He is more interesting still on the subject
of the Maison Carrée, for he gives us, with a
wealth of technical detail and illustration, the
curious reason for its being so supremely satisfying
to the eye.</p>

<p>No one even with an uneducated eye for
beauty can look at this little gem of Greek architecture
without a sensation of pleasure. Mr.
Baring-Gould, whose eye is not uneducated, writes
of it: "It is the best example we have in Europe
of a temple that is perfectly intact. It is <i>mignon</i>,
it is cheerful, it is charming. I found myself
unable at any time to pass it without looking
round over my shoulder, again and again, and
uttering some exclamation of pleasure at the
sight of it."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p class="b1">And Mr. Henry James, in that delightful book,
"A Little Tour in France," writes in his own
way:</p>

<p class="pbq">"The first impression you receive from this
delicate little building, as you stand before it, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that you have already seen it many times. Photographs,
engravings, models, medals, have placed
it definitely in your eye, so that from the sentiment
with which you regard it curiosity and
surprise are almost completely, and perhaps deplorably,
absent. Admiration remains, however,&mdash;admiration
of a familiar and even slightly
patronizing kind. The Maison Carrée does not
overwhelm you; you can conceive it. It is not
one of the great sensations of the antique art;
but it is perfectly felicitous, and, in spite of
having been put to all sorts of incongruous uses,
marvellously preserved. Its slender columns, its
delicate proportions, its charming compactness,
seemed to bring one nearer to the century that
built it than the great superpositions of arenas
and bridges, and give it the interest that vibrates
from one age to another when the note of taste
is struck."</p>

<p class="p1">In a word, the beauty of this little temple is
alive, and one of the reasons for its being so
I now proceed to extract from Mr. Cook's discussion
of a subject that he has made particularly
his own.</p>

<p>Why is it that the Maison Carrée is so eminently
pleasing to the eye&mdash;is alive&mdash;while the
Madeleine in Paris, which is a strictly mathematical
enlargement of it, is "dull and unsuccessful"?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Because the lines of the Madeleine are straight,
and those of this temple, as of all Greek architecture,
are not, though they are so nearly so that
the fact was not discovered until about twenty
years ago.</p>

<p>The divergences are surprisingly small, and in
fact this great secret of the ancient builders&mdash;Egyptian,
Roman, Byzantine and Gothic, as well
as Greek&mdash;was not suspected until it was proved
on the Parthenon in the middle of the last century.
"In the Parthenon the curve is under four inches
in two hundred and twenty-eight feet. At Nîmes
it is nearly five inches in less than a hundred
feet."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>These skilful curves can be traced in Gothic
cathedrals. The walls in the nave of Westminster
Abbey "are bent inwards at about the height
of the keystones of the arches and outwards above
and below this point, and they are structurally
sound unto this day."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cook explains the difference caused by
following this principle "as something of the
difference between an architectural drawing done
with compass and rulers, and an artist's painting
of the same building done with a free hand and
with just those 'inaccuracies' which give it life
and beauty." It is "an essential principle which,
known to Greece, and known to the builders of
the Maison Carrée, is one of the chief reasons
why this little temple is the greatest treasure of
classical architecture north of the Alps."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The Maison Carrée has been at various times
a kind of Hôtel de Ville, a private dwelling, a
stable, a church, a granary, and a public market,
and it is surprising that with all the structural
changes it has undergone there is anything of
it left. But fortunately its exterior was never
much interfered with, and now its interior has
been cleared out, and is used as an antiquarian
museum.</p>

<p>The amphitheatre at Nîmes is very slightly
smaller than that at Arles, but it is rather better
preserved. In fact, it is the best preserved of
any of the Roman amphitheatres&mdash;far better than
the Coliseum, for instance. Its seating accommodation
was about twenty-two thousand, as against
ninety thousand of the Coliseum, but the area
of the arena was in the proportion of about seven
to twelve, so that this provincial city was very
well off in this respect, as compared with the
capital of the world.</p>

<p>The photograph will show what a noble building
this was, and will incidentally provide an
example of the manner in which the French treat
their ancient monuments. You may imagine from
it an ellipse of about four hundred and thirty
feet by three hundred and thirty, all of it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
much the same state. It will be seen that where
the original structure is strong enough it has
been left, where it needs repair the old work has
been copied, and here and there&mdash;as in the balustrading
beneath the upper row of arches&mdash;features
have been restored not absolutely necessary to the
support of the building. There are those who
object to this sort of restoration. I suppose it is
a matter of knowledge and imagination; but ordinary
persons, of whom in questions of architecture
and archæology I am one, may be grateful
for a system that shows plainly what an ancient
building really looked like, and what purposes
it served, while he is nowhere invited to take the
new for the old.</p>

<p>As the original seating accommodation of the
amphitheatre would provide for more than a
quarter of the present inhabitants of Nîmes&mdash;that
at Arles would take some thousands
more than there are now people in Arles&mdash;it
has not been necessary to restore all the
tiers of seats for the uses to which the arena is
put. Consequently, it is possible to see the ingenious
plan on which it was constructed, so as
to give ample means of ingress and egress, and
to divide up the spectators according to their
rank. There were thirty-four tiers of them&mdash;four
for the senators, ten for the knights, ten
for the freedmen, and ten for the slaves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
menials&mdash;and everybody had an uninterrupted
view of what went on in the arena. The holes
for the masts supporting the gigantic awning
that sheltered the spectators can be seen here and
there in the topmost circle; but the moderns do
without that luxury, and watch their bull-fights
in the full glare of the Southern sun.</p>

<p>I cannot describe a Provençal bull-fight, as the
season had not begun when I was in the country,
though preparations were being made for a spectacle
on the following Sunday. It is an ancient
sport with the Provençaux, but, as Mr. Henry
James says, "the thing is shabbily and imperfectly
done. The bulls are rarely killed, and indeed
often are bulls only in the Irish sense of
the term,&mdash;being domestic and motherly cows."
But the "Grande Tauromachie" is creeping in.
Large bills were posted about the amphitheatre
announcing events in which Spanish matadors
and toréadors would compete for the favour of
the populace, and the organizers of the sport were
full of self-commendation of the noble struggle
they were making over the innovation. It seemed
to be almost a matter of conscience with them.
They spoke of their loyalty and simplicity, of
their scrupulous honesty and untiring good-will,
and of the inexhaustible force of energy that they
would bring to bear in this contest against discouraging
circumstance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Mises à Mort they call their Spanish bull-fights,
and to judge by a picture postcard that I bought
of one in progress, in which every seat in the
amphitheatre is occupied, and dense masses of
people are standing where there are no seats,
they are taking very kindly to the pastime.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Aigues-Mortes and the Camargue</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Aigues-Mortes, like Les Baux, is one of those
places which are apt to dawn upon the traveller
only when he is in reach of them. I might hesitate
to confess that I had never heard of Les
Baux before my first journey in Provence, or
of Aigues-Mortes even then, if I had not met
so many well-informed and well-travelled people
who had never heard of either of them.</p>

<p>And yet Aigues-Mortes is a place of absorbing
interest. It is romantically situated on the
edge of the great plain of the Camargue, surrounded
by salt marshes, lagoons, canals, and
only a few miles from the sea. Here the town
is entirely confined within its unbroken mediæval
fortifications, and its walls and gates and towers
are more perfectly preserved than those of any
other fortified town in Europe; more so even
than those of Carcassonne, which owe much to
modern restoration.</p>

<p>The story of its building is soon told, and it
is a story that cannot be forgotten when one
visits the place, for there has been nothing since
that has overshadowed it. The poor little town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
laid out in square "blocks" like an American village
that hopes some day to become a city, has
hardly a voice of its own, it is so nothing-at-all
compared with its girdling ramparts. These are
as nearly as possible a mile round, and probably
the stones of all the buildings they enclose would
not suffice for one side of them. So the walls
and towers are everything at Aigues-Mortes, and
speak insistently of the purpose for which they
were built.</p>

<p>When St. Louis took his crusading vows in
1244, he had to acquire a port from which to
embark. He exchanged land with the Abbey
of Psalmodi for the site of Aigues-Mortes and
the marshland between it and the sea. There
was already an old fortified tower there, erected
five hundred years before as a place of refuge
from the Saracens, and this was rebuilt as the
Tour de Constance. St. Louis also dug the long
winding canal to the sea, which is now completely
silted up, and its place taken, for the barge traffic
to Beaucaire, by one quite straight and about
half its length. By this he embarked an army
of thirty-six thousand men in 1248.</p>

<p>In 1270 he embarked another great crusading
army at Aigues-Mortes, but died almost immediately
upon landing at Tunis.</p>

<p>Between the two crusades the walls of the
fortress town had begun to be built, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
St. Louis's son Philip III who completed the
fortifications as we see them today. They have
lasted for seven centuries and a half, and although
the history of Aigues-Mortes did not quite end
in the thirteenth century, they have sustained
no destruction or decay, and no essential modification.</p>

<p>This, then, is what one sets out to see&mdash;a town
which presents itself to our eyes exactly as it did
to the eyes of the crusaders, who built it. Can
one see the like anywhere else in Europe?</p>

<p>I left Nîmes on a bright Sunday morning and
travelled by the pottering little train that runs
across the plain of the Camargue. It was a
little too far to walk in one day, and I wanted
to see Aigues-Mortes that afternoon and start
early the next morning for Saintes-Maries.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant journey. The flat country
lay soaking in a haze of sunshine, and the hills
to the north showed lovely soft purples and golds
and blues. At first the country reminded me
very much of that stretch of reclaimed marshland
across which one travels to get to our
old English town of Rye. There were brooks
and willows and green fields, and to one who
has lived on "the Marsh" it was plain that all
this fertility had the same origin&mdash;alluvial soil
spread over what was once a bare expanse, from
which the sea had receded. Or perhaps it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
be more accurate to say that I knew the fact and
recognized the signs of it. But after a time this
English-looking scenery gave place to the Provençal
rows of cypresses, to groups and dottings
of stone pines, and to scattered buildings on an
unkinder-looking soil.</p>

<p>After St. Laurent d'Aigouze, the next station
before Aigues-Mortes and ten kilometres from it,
the unreclaimed marsh begins, with stunted vegetation
growing on poor stony soil, and water
here and there, but not yet the great reed-bordered
"étangs," which are the home of so many
wild fowl. To the left of the line straggles the
broad road, and beyond it is the clean-cut line
of the canal that leads from the sea through St.
Gilles to Beaucaire. On a sort of island in the
marsh stand the ruins of the Abbey of Psalmodi,
and a little farther on is the outpost Tour Carbonnière,
which is about two miles from Aigues-Mortes
and its main fortifications.</p>

<p>The line, which runs quite straight from St.
Laurent takes a right-handed turn just before it
reaches Aigues-Mortes, and before the turn comes
you can see the walled city in front of you, just
as you can see the surprising picturesque little
town of Rye, growing out of the marsh, as it
were, before you come to it from Ashford.</p>

<p>"On this absolute level, covered with coarse
grass," writes Mr. Henry James, "Aigues-Mortes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
presents quite the appearance of the walled town
that a schoolboy draws upon his slate, or that we
see in the background of early Flemish pictures,&mdash;a
simple parallelogram, of a contour almost
absurdly bare, broken at intervals by angular
towers and square holes."</p>

<p>The sight makes its instant appeal. One is
back in a long past century, the aspect of which
is familiar from just those pictures which Mr.
James recalls, and from little illuminated drawings
in old manuscripts. There is an agreeable
sense of surprise and recognition, almost of awe.
It is rather as if one had suddenly come face
to face with some dead personage well known
from portraits&mdash;such as Napoleon or Henry VIII.
One had no idea that there was anything left
quite like that.</p>

<p>You mount up through a fortified gateway
into the little town, which although old is almost
entirely devoid of interest. Its rectangular streets
gave me a reminiscence of our old English Cinque
Ports. About the time that Philip le Hardi was
building Aigues-Mortes, Edward I was building,
or causing to be built, the new town of Winchelsea
in place of the old one that had been
submerged by the sea; and Winchelsea was also
laid out in rectangles, and surrounded by walls.
The two princes had crusaded together. Perhaps
they had talked over this new way of laying out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a town, in place of the old way of radiating streets
from a centre; but they could hardly have foreseen
that it would be some hundreds of years before
their plan would be generally adopted.</p>

<p>There is a good inn at Aigues-Mortes, for
people make an excursion of it from Nîmes and
Arles, and on the Sunday I was there there were
a good many visitors. And all the inhabitants of
the town seemed to be about the streets. There
was a confirmation going on in the church, and
after it a well attended funeral, in which none
of the mourners were dressed in black. I would
rather have struck the place on any other day,
for the slight air of bustle and holiday-making
did not suit it. M. Maurice Barrès has made
it the background of "Le Jardin de Berenice,"
and every one who has read that remarkable
novel will remember the atmosphere of brooding
peace and suggestion in which he has
bathed it.</p>

<p class="b1">Mr. Henry James indicates its charm no less
skilfully:</p>

<p class="pbq">"It is true that Aigues-Mortes does a little
business; it sees certain bags of salt piled into
barges which stand in a canal beside it, and
which carry their cargo into actual places. But
nothing could well be more drowsy and desultory
than this industry as I saw it practised, with the
aid of two or three brown peasants and under
the eye of a solitary douanier, who strolled on
the little quay beneath the western wall. 'C'est
bien plaisant, c'est bien paisible,' said this worthy
man, with whom I had some conversation; and
pleasant and peaceful is the place indeed, though
the former of these epithets may suggest an element
of gaiety in which Aigues-Mortes is deficient.
The sand, the salt, the dull sea view,
surround it with a bright, quiet melancholy.
There are fifteen towers and nine gates, five of
which are on the southern side, overlooking the
water. I walked all round the place three times
(it doesn't take long) but lingered most under
the southern wall, where the afternoon light slept
in the dreamiest, sweetest way. I sat down on
an old stone, and looked away to the desolate
salt marshes and the still, shining surface of the
<i>étang</i>; and, as I did so, reflected that this was a
queer little out-of-the-world corner to have been
chosen, in the great dominions of either monarch,
for that pompous interview which took place, in
1538, between Francis I and Charles V."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p class="p1">This meeting between the Emperor and the
Pope and the King of France is one of the few
outstanding episodes in the history of Aigues-Mortes.
It need only be remarked of it that Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
IX's channel had already fallen into disuse, and another
and a shorter one had been dug out through
the lagoons for the royal and papal galleys. This,
from Grau de Croisette, has also ceased to be
practicable, and the present canal starts from
Grau de Roi, a little fishing and bathing resort
at the nearest possible point on the coast, to
which this railway also runs.</p>

<p class="b1">Another chapter in the history of Aigues-Mortes&mdash;the
last before it sank to be the unimportant
village it is now&mdash;is a long and painful
one. It centres round the strong Tour de Constance,
which was used as a prison for Protestants
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, until
the horror was finally removed from it in 1767.
It was mostly women who were interned in it
during long years, amidst circumstances of great
cruelty. I quote, from Mr. T. A. Cook's pages,
the account of one who accompanied the Prince
de Beauvan in his mission of release.</p>

<p class="pbq">"We found at the entry of the tower," writes
de Boufflers, "an eager guardian, who led us
through a dark and twisting passage, and opened
a great clanging door on which Dante's line might
well have been inscribed: <i>Lasciate ogni speranza
voi ch' entrate</i>. I have no colours in which to
paint the terrors of the picture which gradually
grew upon our unaccustomed eyes. The scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
was hideous yet pathetic, and interest in its victims
struggled with disgust at their condition.
Almost without air and light, fourteen women
languished in misery and tears within that stone-walled
chamber. As the commandant, who was
visibly touched, entered the apartment, they all
fell down together at his feet. I can still see
them, bathed in tears, struggling to speak, unable
at first to do anything but sob. Encouraged by
our evident sympathy they all began to tell us
their sorrows at once. Alas, the crime for which
they were then suffering was the fact that they
had been brought up in the same religion as Henri
Quatre. The youngest of them was fifty, and
she had been here since she was eight years old.
In a loud voice that shook with emotion the marshal
said, 'You are free!' and I was proud to be
his servant at that moment."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p class="p1">You can visit the three round chambers, one
above the other, in which these unfortunate women
were imprisoned, which are in exactly the same
structural state. Their walls are of enormous
thickness, and they are lighted by mere slits of
windows. They have been swept and furnished,
and one can admire their vaulting and other architectural
features, but not without a thought of
the misery that they contained, which is too recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and too detailed to lose any of its horror in the
mists of time.</p>

<p>At the other end of the north-west wall is the
Tour des Bourgignans, round which also cling
dreadful memories. In 1421 a party of Burgundians
seized the town but were all massacred
and their bodies were thrown into this tower,
and covered with salt in order to avoid a plague.</p>

<p>To the south of Aigues-Mortes lie the shimmering
lagoons and the desolate marshlands of
the Carmague, which breed fever and ague, and
make the peace of the little dead town not altogether
so desirable. This great plain, which contains
something like twenty thousand acres, has
had a varied history. It is naturally formed by
the Rhône delta. The river rolls down its
detritus which gradually chokes up its mouth.
There is no tide in the Mediterranean to scour
it out, and a bar is formed. Then the river has
to find another outlet, and this happens again
and again until it has wandered all over a large
area, leaving behind it more and more deposit
raised above the sea level. In the meantime, behind
the bars thrown up both by the river and
the sea, are left lagoons of fresh water, into
which the sea sometimes rushes in times of storm,
and leaves behind brackish and stagnant water.</p>

<p>Now in classical times it was well understood
that if outlets to these lagoons were kept open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
not only were their surroundings perfectly healthy,
but that natural forces would do what was necessary
to turn the great expanse of the Camargue
from a desert waste into fertile corn-growing land.
These natural forces were the simple ones which
have made the Nile and other deltoid rivers the
fertilizers of the land about them&mdash;periodical
floodings and changes of their beds. In fact in
the time of the Roman occupation the Camargue
was called "The granary of the Roman army,"
and Arles, which was the market for its corn was
so flowing with plenty as to be called "The
Breasts."</p>

<p>Why is only part of this great stretch of land
now fertile, and the rest a desolating waste? The
mistake was made in the sixteenth century, when
the engineers of Louis XIV examined the country
and made recommendations for its treatment.
The outlets from the lagoons had been allowed
to get choked up, and the Camargue had for long
been a fever-breeding waste instead of providing
the rich corn land that it had once done. The
king's engineers recommended the embanking of
the Rhône, so that it should be kept to its course,
instead of flooding the adjacent land, and the
building of dykes against the inrush of the sea.
Drains, protected by traps, were also cut to carry
out the stagnant water from the lagoons into the
sea, and all this was done at an original cost of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
about a million pounds, and is kept up at an
annual cost of about five thousand. There are
now two hundred and thirty miles of dike, and
although the land is fertile enough where the
Rhône is allowed its periodical overflow, and has
been laboriously reclaimed elsewhere, the main
effect of these works has been to reduce the
Camargue to sterility. It has been estimated that
at every overflow of the Rhône, eighteen thousand
cubic yards of rich alluvial soil was deposited over
the land. This is now carried out to sea, and
thrown down to make new bars. Perhaps some
day the work will be done again, the dikes removed
and the river allowed to take its natural
course. All that would have to be done then
would be to keep open the mouths of the lagoons,
to prevent them from stagnating and breeding
fever and ague; and then the whole Camargue
would once more be one of the most fertile tracts
of the earth.</p>

<p>In the meantime it has its own picturesque
wild life, just as the fen country of eastern England
had before it was drained. As in all flat
countries it domed with magnificent skies; the
mirage is a common effect of the scorched desolation;
flights of rose-coloured flamingoes are to
be seen among the commoner wild fowl. Bulls
and horses roam the great solitudes in a wild
state, until the time comes round for one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
those great pastoral man&oelig;uvres, half business,
half sport, in which a whole countryside takes
part, when the animals that are wanted are cut
out from the rest and their ownership settled.</p>

<p>The <i>Guardiens</i> ride over the wide territory
committed to their charge, mounted on wiry little
white horses of the breed that is most common on
the plain. They are splendid-looking young men,
for the most part, and it gave me quite a thrill
to see one of them a few days later. For there is
a romance about them, and the wild yet anciently
ordered life they lead, which is hardly of our civilization.
You may read all about it in some of
the novels of Jean Aicard, and especially in "Roi
de Camargue," which seems to cry aloud for
translation into English, it is so much finer than
later ones by which he is chiefly known here.
Now that Mistral and Daudet are dead Jean
Aicard is the chief literary interpreter of Provençal
life, and in his pictures of this wild life of
the great plains with its primitive pursuits and
passions he stands supreme.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Saintes-Maries de la Mer</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">I was on the road early the next morning with
a twenty-mile walk before me to Saintes-Maries
de la Mer. I had to follow the canal for a
couple of miles to the north, then to strike across
the plain to the westward, then to follow the
course of the Little Rhône to the south. This
took me through country that has been for the
most part reclaimed, and grows acres upon acres
of vines. To the south and west of Aigues-Mortes
it is nothing but <i>étangs</i> and unreclaimed
marsh, and if there is a way through it all I
could hardly have expected to find it and should
certainly have been cut off by water besides.</p>

<p>The walk was not very inspiring. Any one
who knows the reclaimed fen lands of Lincolnshire
and Cambridgeshire will agree that, fertile
though these flats may be, they provide the modicum
of picturesque scenery. I imagine that the
vine-growing industry hereabouts is a comparatively
new thing, but it is already a big one.
After walking along a straight road between
vineyards&mdash;flat fields regularly planted with vines
about the size of small gooseberry bushes&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
five miles, I saw ahead of me an enormous
castellated, spired building which I afterwards
learnt to be a wine lodge, but which was not on
my map at all. And just outside the walls of
Aigues-Mortes they have recently erected a building
having to do with the shipping or storage
of wine over which there has been a good deal
of controversy; for it is built in a sham castellated
style, and interferes with the effect of the ancient
fortifications.</p>

<p>My road turned before I came to the big
building I have mentioned, and presently the
fields became less ruled and planed, and little
bits of untouched marshland began to encroach
upon them. I came to the hamlet of Sylvéreal
at a turn of the Little Rhône, where there is a
bridge and a road running to Saintes-Maries on
either side of the river. I refreshed myself at a
poor little inn and was heavily charged for sour
bread and hard cheese. But these regions are
really out of the world, habitations are sparse
and communications rare. Five miles further on
I came to a ferry&mdash;the Bac du Sauvage&mdash;and
was put across the Little Rhône, which is not
little at all, but a big river with a rapid flow.
Except for the quite good road, one might well
have imagined oneself during these last miles in
a new country gradually being opened up. The
river carries no merchandise, its banks are deserted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Since Aigues-Mortes, in sixteen miles or
so, I had passed no village except Sylvéreal,
and there cannot be more than a dozen houses
there. I could not rid myself of the feeling of
being somewhere in the bush of Australia, which
I know best of the new countries. Even the
occasional wayside shanties were not absent&mdash;little
groups of them occasionally, in which there was
nearly always one announcing itself as that of a
<i>coiffeur</i>.</p>

<p>The feeling vanished when I came within sight
of the fortress church of Saintes-Maries towering
above the low roofs of the village that surrounds
it. It could be seen from afar across the plain,
and immediately carried the mind back to the
past, which is never very far away from you
wherever you go in Provence. And this is one
of the most ancient and storied places of the
whole country. The walls and towers of Aigues-Mortes
are new beside it. If you reject the story
of the landing of the New Testament saints here&mdash;and
you will find it hard to reject in Saintes-Maries
itself&mdash;still the church itself dates partly
from the tenth century; it was built on the
site of another church destroyed by the Saracens;
and that church was built on the site of a temple
erected by Augustus. In Roman times there
was a sort of island here, and a prosperous settlement.
The state of almost destitution to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the wretched little town has come must be owing
to the defertilization of the Camargue, of which
I have already written. But in the time of King
René it was a prosperous town with many privileges,
afterwards confirmed to it by the kings
of France, and at least since that time the church
has been the object of a yearly pilgrimage that
has kept its fame alive to an extent that is perhaps
not equalled anywhere in France, except at
Lourdes.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that "Les Saintes," as it
is commonly called, must be now at the very
nadir of its poverty. It is right on the edge of
the Mediterranean, and beautiful firm sands
backed by sand dunes stretch away from it on
either side. It is on a little line of railway from
Arles; and by far the nearest possible watering-place
to that city, and even to Avignon. In fact,
Le Grau du Roi, near Aigues-Mortes, would be
its only rival for the central cities of Provence.
In England, a place of this historical importance
and advantageous situation would be a prosperous
town instead of a squalid village.</p>

<p>I need scarcely say that to the sentimental
traveller the present dejected state of Saintes-Maries,
in which nothing detracts from the extraordinary
interest of its shrine, is a boon almost
beyond gratitude. But one can hardly help being
struck by its possibilities, and the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
France and England in respect of making
use of such; nor by the fact that at any time
the whole aspect of the place may become
changed.</p>

<p>There are two inns in Saintes-Maries, and I
went to the worst of them, because it faced the
sea. It was the dirtiest inn I struck in Provence,
but that was not altogether the fault of the proprietors,
as part of it was rebuilding. Perhaps
the visitors to Saintes-Maries have already begun
to demand more accommodation, and this is
the sign of it. I did come across one honeymoon
couple, or one that looked like it, sunning themselves
below the stones of the dike in view of
the shining Mediterranean, but I walked along
the sands to the mouth of the Little Rhône, a
distance of about two miles, without seeing any
one else, except a few fishermen. And at the
mouth of the river there were only a few scattered
huts. It seemed almost ludicrous that a
mighty and famous river&mdash;even if only the lesser
branch of it&mdash;should be allowed to take to the
sea with so little ceremony. Again the likeness
to a stretch of coast in a brand-new country was
overwhelming. But one only had to turn round
and see that ancient church for the odd sensation
to pass away again; and only the peace and
the windy solitude of the sea remained of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The church is, I think, the most compelling
thing in Provence. The photograph will give
an idea of its fortress exterior, but not of the
way it dominates the country for miles around.
That is a thing to remember, but unfortunately
my own photograph, taken from the shore some
little way off, went wrong.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes one in the dark interior&mdash;what
windows there are are mere slits
in the thick wall&mdash;are the rows of rough deal
seating that run round three sides of the church
in a sort of narrow gallery. These are for the
crowds that come on May 24th, and during the
following week for the great annual festival, when
the coffin containing the bones of the blessed
saints is let down from the chapel above the apse,
and the church is packed full of pilgrims. They
are a makeshift affair and do not add to the dignity
of the church, although they serve to remind
one that this church does not depend for its fame
on its age or architecture.</p>

<p>The high altar with its simple decoration of
wrought iron stands forward. The priest celebrates
facing the congregation; it is a privilege
granted by the Pope to this church. Immediately
in front of it is the entrance to the crypt. In
front of that, just aside from the main aisle, is
the miraculous well, with pitcher and pulley all
complete.</p>

<p>When the saints landed near to this place, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
set about building a little oratory, "erecting an
altar for the celebration of the holy mysteries,
as near as possible like to the one which Moses
constructed by the order of God. The two Marys,
with Martha and Magdalene, prepared the ground
for this purpose, and God made known to them
how agreeable in his eyes were their devotion
and their sacrifices, by causing to spring up a
fountain of sweet water in a place where hitherto
only salt water had been known."</p>

<p>This well must have been of the utmost value
to those who stood a siege in the church some
hundreds of years later, and may be thought to
have been sunk for that purpose. But its miraculous
properties are still recognized, and its waters
are resorted to by "persons bitten by enraged
animals."</p>

<p>The narrow little chapels that line the church
are fuller of votive offerings than any others I
have seen. Besides the usual <i>ex voto</i> tablets, and
chaplets and ribbons of first communions, there is
a regular picture gallery of miraculous escapes,
most of them, it must be confessed, of the lowest
possible artistic value, but going a long way back,
and telling a series of tales of considerable interest.</p>

<p>A characteristic one, which bears the date of
1777, is of a man being attacked by five dogs.
His companion is not going to his assistance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
is represented on his knees, and in an upper corner
of the picture appear the two Marys, who
presumably saved the victim from any ill effects
of the attack. Another rather well-executed pencil
drawing represents a man dragging a horse
out of a swollen river. Another is of a child
being run over&mdash;or possibly just not run over&mdash;by
a cart. Many are of elderly people in bed
with friends and relatives standing around them&mdash;and
the saints in their usual corner.</p>

<p>In one of the chapels are the old carved wood
figures of the two Marys in their boat, which
are carried every year in procession to the sea,
and into it, in commemoration of the miraculous
voyage which ended at this place.</p>

<p>I don't know how it was that I did not realize
on my first visit to the church that the chapel
containing the sacred remains, the outside of
which can be seen in the photograph above the
apse, was to be seen by taking a little trouble
about it. From the inside of the church appear
the doors from which the double ark is let down
by ropes and carried in procession, but I had
not thought that there was rather an elaborate
chapel up there behind the doors. It was rather
late in the evening when the old priest came
out from his presbytery to take me up to it.</p>

<p>It is approached by a narrow, winding stairway
from the outside of the church, and is about forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
feet from the ground. It was enriched in the time
of Louis XV, but its decorations were much damaged
by the Revolutionaries. The pictured coffer
containing the relics of the saints is in a chamber
closed by ornamented double doors, in which are
also the pulleys and cords by which it is lowered
to the floor of the church on the great day of the
pilgrimage. All round the little chapel are the
crutches and other offerings of those who have
been cured by attendance at the shrine. One of
the latest is a sort of strait-waistcoat left behind
by a cripple who had used it for many years,
but went away, as the curé told me, on his own
feet, and praising God and the blessed saints.</p>

<p>I walked all round the strong battlements, from
which a glorious view extends itself, of the plain
with its bright sheets of water on the one side,
and the sea and the sands on the other. It was
a lovely, peaceful evening, and the old priest admired
it as much as I did. He said he liked
to come up here away from the world, and often
said his Mass in the quiet chapel high above the
low roofs of the town. I bought from him the
little book he has written about his church, which
contains the hymns and prayers and canticles,
partly in Latin, partly in French, partly in Provençal,
that are used during the days of pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Of the church as a work of defence, he writes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
"It is a fortress, with its sentry's walk, its watch
tower, its crenellations and machicolations. When
Saracens or pirates invaded us, and during the
wars of religion, the men went up to the high
chapel for defence, at the summons of the watchman,
who gave the alarm, while the women and
children were shut up in the church, which communicated
by two staircases with the roof. During
the religious wars, the church was smoked
out several times by the assailants."</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when we went down into
the crypt, and what I saw of the tomb of the
servant Sarah was by the light of a candle which
the curé lit for me, dropping the grease about
plentifully, as seems to be the way of those who
show sacred treasures. It will be remembered
that this black servant of the holy ladies accompanied
them on their miraculous voyage to Provence.
Her body, exhumed with theirs, under
the auspices of the good King René, and in his
presence, was reburied here, and this half subterranean
chapel at Saintes-Maries has been from
time immemorial the centre of a cult, the strangest
of any with which we have to do.</p>

<p>At the time of the yearly pilgrimage, when
good Catholics come to venerate die remains of
the saints, there come also hordes of gipsies, who
prostrate themselves before the tomb of the servant
Sarah, and practise strange rites which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
nothing to do with the Christian religion. The
good curé in his book mentions the fact that they
come in, but says nothing about their worship,
which is said to include the adoration of fire, and
other mysteries of an immemorially old religion.</p>

<p>I have been able to find nothing very illuminating
that bears upon this strange survival and
its origins. The Marquis de Baroncelli-Javon has
published a little illustrated pamphlet which is of
some interest on the subject of gipsies in general,
and those that are to be found in this stretch
of seaboard in particular, but he is not able to
suggest why St. Sarah, as he calls her&mdash;but I
do not think that she was ever canonized, or regarded
as a Christian saint&mdash;should have attracted
to herself this ancient worship, except by reminding
us that she was commonly supposed to be an
Egyptian, which is hardly convincing. But that
the gipsies should gather at this particular spot
and perform their rites, he does find some reason
for, and his theories are at least interesting.</p>

<p>He says, first of all, that there are two distinct
races of <i>Bohémiens</i> different in feature, in bone
formation, colour, character, language and traditions;
that they have nothing in common and treat
each other not only as strangers but often as
enemies. "A gipsy who traffics in horses will
never have anything to do with one who leads
about dancing bears or works in copper; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
will be no understanding between them and they
will treat one another with indifference if not with
hatred. But this trafficker in horses will immediately
recognize as his blood brother another
<i>maquignon</i> at Saintes-Maries, it matters not where
he comes from."</p>

<p>Now at Saintes-Maries the gipsies with performing
bears, or the tinsmiths, are never to be
met with. These are the Zingaris, and their home
is in the east of Europe. They talk the languages
of the north and the east willingly and easily,
but with difficulty those of the south.</p>

<p>The gipsies who are to be found in Spain,
Languedoc, Provence and parts of Italy call
themselves Gitanos or Gitans. These are they
who come once at least during their life wanderings
to Saintes-Maries, "to salute the earth, to
fulfil strange rites, and to regard the sea, their
eyes fixed in ecstasy." Where do they come
from?</p>

<p>"From the parts where the sun sets," they
say of themselves; and if you ask an American
Indian the same question he will tell you that
he comes "from the parts where the sun rises."
They are the ancient inhabitants, says M. de
Baroncelli-Javon, of the lost Atlantis, which lay
between the old world and the new.</p>

<p>The resemblances between the Gitanos and the
Redskins are curious, not only in appearance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
language but in many small details and habits.
They use, for instance, exactly the same actions
when they examine a horse's teeth. The author
adds to the list of survivors of Atlantis the
Basques, the Bretons and perhaps the Copts of
Egypt, and finds resemblances in them too. My
small ethnological knowledge prompts me to reject
the Bretons, but the Basques have always
been a puzzle, and seem to fit in with this theory.
There is also a hint, in a footnote, of the inclusion
of the Laps, Samoyeds, and Esquimaux, whom we
might perhaps accept in place of the Celts.</p>

<p>But to continue. The Egyptians and the
Gitanos&mdash;probably two branches of the same family&mdash;found
themselves on either side of the Mediterranean.
The Egyptians moved westwards to
the Nile and the Red Sea, the Gitanos took up
a roving life and were to be found everywhere
along the coast, from the Gaudalquiver to the Var.
They are thus not descendants, but brothers of the
Egyptian race.</p>

<p>"Little by little arrive the Iberians, and then
others and still others. The Gitano flies before
the invader; he finds refuge nearer and nearer to
the coast, following the last wild horses into the
most lonely places, among the lagoons and the
unhealthy marshes, uninhabitable by all except
him, the aboriginal. There he erects his temples,
in which he adores Fire and the Sun, like the Redskin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and the Egyptian, where he buries his chiefs
and his wise men, thus consecrating special places.
And he is always moving on, with the wild horse,
along the line of the sea. Centuries and centuries
pass, Christianity shines forth, which founds the
altars of its saints on those of the pagans, and it
is not unscientific to think that the pilgrimage to
the place of the Saintes-Maries existed long before
Christianity, and honoured first the gods of
the soil, then those of the Iberians and Ligurians,
before it honoured our saints."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Saint-Gilles and Montmajour</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">This was to be the last full day's walk. I had
to meet a friend at Avignon the next afternoon;
then to Arles with no further time for walking;
and then home.</p>

<p>There was a lot of ground to cover. The first
stage, after going halfway to Arles by train, was
an eight-mile walk across the plain to Saint-Gilles.
The train started at six, and soon after seven I
was on the road, on a fine still spring morning,
and in company with an old peasant woman who
was also going to Saint-Gilles, and had suggested
in the train that we should walk together. I had
not known quite how to refuse, but had thought
that after a mile or so I might say that I was
in a hurry, and push on from her. Provençal was
her tongue, and French is not mine; the burden
of a conversation lasting for two hours daunted me.</p>

<p>We walked and talked together for about a
mile, and although she must have been getting
on for seventy, and carried a heavy basket, her
steady pace was just a trifle faster than my usual
one at the beginning of a long day's walk. I
could not for shame suggest that I should drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
back; besides, she would have offered to walk
more slowly. So when we had exhausted the
first burst of conversation, I drew myself together,
lifted my hat, and with a word of apology, forged
on ahead with all the air of a Marathon racer.</p>

<p>She chased me for miles. Whenever I looked
back I saw her plodding form on the straight road
across the marsh. I was ashamed of myself, but
I couldn't keep it up. The walk to Saint-Gilles
was only to be the beginning of my day. At a
wide turn of the road I took what looked to be
an easy short cut across the marsh. If it had
been easy, of course she would have taken it too,
and the end of it was that when I came out on
to the road again after my windings there was
her black determined figure a quarter of a mile
ahead of me. So I let her take her pace, and
I took mine, and she crossed the great suspension
bridge into Saint-Gilles nearly half an hour before
I did. I saw her the whole way, and she never
looked round. I hope she thought I was ahead
of her.</p>

<p>Scarcely any of its original importance is left
to Saint-Gilles, which dates from the earliest
dawn of Provençal history. It was the Ph&oelig;nician
Heraktra. In those days the branch of the
Rhône upon which it stands was an open trade
route. The Ph&oelig;nician traders came to it from
their expeditions to Britain, by way of the Seine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
valley and the Rhône. Early in the twelfth century
the building of one of the noblest churches
in Provence was begun here; and its remains, in
spite of the successive destructions and mutilations
it has received, make it still well worth a
visit.</p>

<p>All that is left in its original state is the wonderful
carved façade, which is finer even than
the famous one, of about the same date, of St.
Trophimus at Arles, and takes in three portals
instead of one. It is in its original state only as
far as its main structure is concerned, for its figures
have been sadly mutilated by successive generations
of enraged Protestants. But one can
be thankful to them for sparing it at all, instead
of treating it as they did the church behind it.</p>

<p>The story of St. Gilles is charmingly told by
M. J. Charles-Roux, in his "Légendes de Provence."</p>

<p>He was a Greek, of royal lineage. In all
the country there was not to be found a man
richer than his father, or a woman more chaste
and charitable than his mother. He was baptized
with great rejoicing, and from an early age his
parents sought to bring him up in their faith.
At seven years of age he was taught his letters,
and thus early he devoted himself to study and
the service of God. Modest and of fine address,
he grew into the flower of his country's youth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
his hair was fair and curling, his skin as white
as milk, he had a delicate nose and ears, white
teeth and a sweet mouth.</p>

<p>The day came when God was ready to show
His designs concerning him. He was on his way
to school, when he saw crouching in the gutter a
poor cripple, pale, hideous and horrible. The child
addressed him, and he replied, "Sir, hunger is
killing and cold overwhelming me; death is near,
and I only want to die." Gilles's eyes filled with
tears, and as he had neither silver nor gold he
gave the poor wretch his coat, and he at once
arose cured and thanked God with such fervour
that presently more than a hundred persons appeared
on the scene.</p>

<p>The fame of Gilles's holiness began to spread,
and soon afterward he healed a man bitten by a
venomous snake.</p>

<p>After his father and mother died he was
pressed to marry by his vassals, who wished him
to continue his royal race, but he begged a respite.
He was much troubled by the crowd that besieged
his doors&mdash;crippled, dumb, blind, lame,&mdash;who
besought him to heal them. He was willing
to do so, but dreaded the worldly fame that was
beginning to attach itself to his name. He wished
to seek a road that would bring him nearer to
God, and he determined to go to Rome.</p>

<p>He ordered a great feast in his palace, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
night, when all were sleeping, overcome with the
fumes of wine, after praying for a long time he
left his chamber softly, and made his escape from
the battlements, hidden in a fog. He was never
seen there again.</p>

<p>After wandering on foot for a long time, he
came to the sea, and saw a ship being driven on to
the rocks in a storm. He prayed to God, and the
storm abated, and the ship came safe to shore.
He asked the sailors to take him to Rome, and
they, recognizing him for a holy man, took him
on board.</p>

<p>They were for the most part Provençals, and
were carrying a rich cargo of corn from Russia,
silks, precious stuffs and spices. They sailed for
days under a clear sky, and never had to touch
a rope, for God was guiding them.</p>

<p>They landed at Marseilles, and Gilles, who
had been so rich, went from door to door, begging
his food. After a time, having heard of the good
bishop, Cæsar of Arles, he went to that ancient
city. He lodged with a widow whose daughter
had been paralysed for twelve years. When he
had prayed for a moment beside her bed she arose
well and joyful. When the good bishop heard
of this miracle, he sent his archdeacon to bring
Gilles to him. The archdeacon found him praying
in the church. The bishop received him with affection
and honour and kept him by him for twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
years, during which time he wrought many
miracles.</p>

<p>But this was not the sort of life Gilles had
dreamed of. He escaped from Arles and plunged
into the wild forest which surrounded it. At last
he came to a monstrous rock in which some steps
had been cut. He climbed up them and found a
pious hermit with whom he lived for twelve years
in perfect communion of prayer and meditation.</p>

<p>Although his retreat was remote and hidden,
the piety and the miracles of St. Gilles were so
renowned that at last it was discovered. So he
resolved to find a hiding-place more impenetrable
still.</p>

<p>He wandered far into the forest until he came
to a cave choked with brambles. He hid its opening
with branches, leaves and clods of turf, and
took it as his hermitage. A fresh spring welled
up at a short distance from it, round which grew
a cress upon which he sustained himself until
God sent him a doe which gave him milk. Every
day while he was at his prayers she went into the
forest to feed, and returned at fixed hours to the
cave, where Gilles had prepared for her a couch
near his own.</p>

<p>At this time Florenz was king in Provence,
under Charlemagne. Holding his Christmas court
at Montpelier, he entertained all the lords of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
country round at banquets and parties of the
chase. One evening as they were feasting news
was brought in by the royal huntsman of a wonderful
white hind that had been tracked to her hiding-place
in the forest, and early the following morning
the king set out with a great retinue to chase
her. The chase was long and Florenz found himself
ahead of his companions with the hind flying
in front of him. As she was disappearing among
the trees, he launched an arrow at her, and immediately
the hermit, Gilles, appeared, to whom the
hind had flown for shelter, and whose hand the
king's arrow had pierced.</p>

<p>After this the king conceived a great veneration
for the saint, visited him often alone and
pressed him to accept presents. Gilles resisted
him for a long time, but said at last: "Sire, if
you really wish to give me a portion of your
lands, of your treasures, of your vessels of gold
and silver, found a monastery upon this spot,
and fill it with monks for the service of God, who
shall pray day and night for your people and for
your law."</p>

<p>"I will do so," said the king, "if you will be
their abbot."</p>

<p>After much hesitation Gilles consented, and
the noble abbey was built and greatly enriched
by gifts from the king. Gilles continued to live
in it the same life as he had lived in the woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and that his flesh might be still further mortified
he prayed that the wound in his hand might
never heal; which prayer was granted to him.</p>

<p>After a time Gilles's great renown reached
Charlemagne, who wished to confess his sins to
so holy a man, and sent an embassy to invite him
to Paris. After consultation with his brethren
he went there, and was received with the utmost
veneration and magnificence. But the honour
done to him caused him nothing but shame.</p>

<p>Charlemagne confessed all his sins but one,
which he had not the courage to avow. Gilles
pleaded with him for twenty days, but in vain.
One Sunday, as he was going to celebrate the
Mass at St. Croix he saw a demoniac chained to
a pillar of the church. His prayers drove out
the demon; all the bells in the city began to ring,
and the king came with a great crowd to hear
the Mass. During the celebration Gilles prayed
that the king might be brought to confess the sin
that it would cost him so much to acknowledge,
and an angel appeared above the altar and deposited
near the sacred Host a little letter which
God Himself had sent His faithful servant.
You can see the scene sculptured on a pillar in
the cathedral of Chartres. The letter announced
that the famous sin, of which we do not know the
details, might be remitted to the king together
with all other sins humbly confessed and secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
detested; also that the saint's own life would soon
end and his reign in glory begin.</p>

<p>Gilles, refusing the king's rich presents, made
the journey back to his monastery in great pain
because of his still open wound, but in great joy,
and learnt that during his absence his monks had
behaved in all respects as he could have wished
them. He resumed his customary life of prayer
and meditation, but feeling that he would not for
long continue to direct the affairs of his flourishing
abbey, and that the favour of kings was fleeting,
he determined to go to Rome to put his
monastery under the protection of the Holy See.</p>

<p>The Pope received him with great honour and
granted his request. He also showed his interest
in the church that St. Gilles had built by giving
him two doors of cypress wood, wonderfully
carved. St. Gilles threw them into the Tiber,
commanding the water to carry them to his church.
He himself arrived at the moment when they
stranded on the banks of the river, in perfect
preservation, and was made happy by this still
further proof of divine favour.</p>

<p>His work was now done, and he prepared
himself for death. His monks stood around him,
scarcely able to recite the sacred offices because
of their sobs. Just before midnight he began to
recall to them events in the life of the Saviour,
and at the moment of death he had a vision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the glorious resurrection of Our Lord, and prayed
St. Michael to conduct him to God. These were
his last words; he made signs of blessing those
who knelt around him, and two of them saw
angels take the soul that issued from his lips, to
carry it to Paradise.</p>

<p>Although the story which I have condensed
speaks of Charlemagne, it was his grandfather,
Charles Martel, in whose reign St. Gilles lived,
and who gave him shelter when he fled from the
Saracens who had attacked his monastery. But
St. Gilles did die in peace in it in 721, and he
had long before handed over the property to the
Holy See, for the Pope's Bull taking it over in
685 is still extant.</p>

<p>The fine crypt, which fortunately still remains,
was constructed in the eleventh century to receive
the tomb of the saint, and its high altar consecrated
by the Pope in 1095. The church above
it was begun twenty years later, and its magnificence
can be judged from the ruins of the
choir, which stretch far to the east of the present
building, as well as from the carving of the front
which took over thirty years to complete. In
1562 the victorious Protestant troops murdered
the priests and the choir boys and threw their
bodies into the well that is still to be seen in the
crypt. The church, says Mr. T. A. Cook, "was
alternately desecrated by the reformers and used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
as a fortress by the churchmen." It was completely
destroyed in 1622, the tomb of St. Gilles
removed and the crypt filled with rubbish; "and
the façade itself seems only to have been left
standing in order that its carvings might the more
openly be debased and mutilated." At the Revolution
still further havoc was wrought, and it
was not until seventy years later that the crypt
was excavated and restored under the auspices
of the Commission of "Monuments Historiques,"
who also restored as far as possible the façade.</p>

<p>Considering the vicissitudes it has gone through
this splendid work retains a surprising effect. It
stretches right across the front of the church,
except for the two narrow towers on each flank,
and is of a wonderful interest and richness. Another
wonderful relic is the Vis de St. Gilles, the
spiral stone staircase that stands among the ruins
of the choir, and the tower. It is famous everywhere
among architects for the delicacy and preciseness
of its stone-cutting and vaulting.</p>

<p>Another thing to see in Saint-Gilles is the
Maison-Romaine, a tall town house of the twelfth
century which was restored at the same time as the
church. It comes as something of a surprise to the
inexpert, it looks so very modern&mdash;rather like the
sort of house an advanced architect might build
in Munich today. But its proportions are beautiful,
and the quiet wall space contrasting with
the decorations of the windows is very effective.
Indeed, the advanced architect might do worse
than copy such a model. After eight hundred
years he could learn more of the twelfth century
builder than he could teach him.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">I took train to Arles and walked straight out
of the station towards the Abbey of Montmajour
two miles distant. Arles itself was to wait for a
few days.</p>

<p>The road lay along a broad shady avenue too
full of traffic for pleasurable tramping, but turned
off presently from the main road to Tarascon,
and the mass of the great Abbey could be seen
towering above the trees across the open country.</p>

<p>This great Benedictine abbey, under the stones
of which lie buried the ancient kings of Arles,
was founded in the sixth century, and its splendid
church was rebuilt in the eleventh and thirteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>It was situated on an island among the lagoons
of the Camargue, but now stands overlooking
the fertile plain right away to the sea, on what
is no more than a low hill overgrown on one side
by a little wood.</p>

<p>I left the road, which goes round by the front,
and climbed up through the trees, to find myself
in a littered farmyard, with the walls of a seventeenth
century building, now in ruins, towering
above me. The remains of a carved stone staircase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
finished off by a rickety wooden bridge ran
up under a bold arch, and had a very extraordinary
effect, springing thus out of the straw and
muck of the yard. This great palace, joined on to
the original monastic buildings, seems strangely
out of place even now, more than a hundred years
after both suffered the same destruction. It was
built when the abbey was at its richest and proudest,
but was not occupied for long, for the Revolution
swept new and old alike away. Of all
the treasures it contained, only three remain&mdash;a
Bible of 1320, which is in the museum at Arles,
an abbatial cross in the museum of Cluny, and
a twelfth century pyx, now in the Louvre.</p>

<p>What remain of the buildings themselves have
suffered no less changes of ownership. When they
were sold by the state after the Revolution many
of the walls were broken down and the stones
taken away to build bridges and houses and to
mend roads. The painter Réatlu of Arles bought
the great tower and saved it. The chapel of
St. Croix became the property of a fisherman,
but finally fell into the hands of the city of
Arles, and was restored and maintained by them.
This stands apart from the rest of the abbey, of
which the site is still private property. Until
recently the later buildings were partly inhabited
by peasants. Gradually the rest has been bought
back, and classed among the "Monuments Historiques."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
The buildings thus saved from further
desecration are the church with its crypt and
cloisters, the tower, the "Confessional" of St.
Trophimus, and the chapel of St. Croix, and each
and all of these are remarkable.</p>

<p>The church, which was begun early in the eleventh
century and was never quite finished, is of
a severe and grateful simplicity. The enormous
crypt beneath it is of a still earlier date, and is
still more remarkable. The apse is divided into
five little chapels opening on to an ambulatory,
and from each can be seen the high altar. The
cloisters are best preserved of anything, and retain
their stone penthouse roofing.</p>

<p>But the most interesting thing about Montmajour
is the little chapel, part scooped out of
the living rock, part built in the ninth century,
which is called the Confessional of St. Trophimus.</p>

<p>You descend to it down stairs cut in the side
of the rock. It stands in a sort of overgrown
garden, and looks as if it were trying to hide
itself. Its rock chambers were no doubt used
by the early Christians for hiding and shelter, in
the same way as the catacombs at Rome. At the
east end is a big chamber almost entirely filled
with a stone bench, which opens into two other
chambers. Whether St. Trophimus was ever there
or not, it has very much the appearance of a
confessional. And scepticism sinks before this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
pathetic little secret place, in which beyond doubt
the holy mysteries were celebrated and the faith
taught at a date before one can be certain of perhaps
any other ecclesiastical remains in the country,
whatever antiquity they may claim.</p>

<p class="b1">The curious Eastern-looking Chapel of St.
Croix stands at some little distance from the
rest of the abbey buildings. It is in the form
of a Greek cross with four semi-circular apses
radiating from a central square-domed tower, and
a porch attached to that on the west. Its date
is 1019, but there was probably a cemetery on
this spot at a much earlier date, and it was built
entirely as a mortuary chapel. Viollet le Duc
wrote of it:</p>

<p class="pbq">"The monks brought their dead here processionally;
the body was placed in the porch and
the brethren remained outside. When Mass was
said, the body was blessed, and it was conveyed
through the chapel and out at the little south
door, to lay it in the grave. The only windows
which lighted this chapel looked into the walled
cemetery. At night, a lamp burned in the centre
of this monument, and, in conformity with the
use of the first centuries of the Middle Ages,
these three little windows let the gleam of the
lamp fall upon the graves. During the office
for the dead a brother tolled the bell hung in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
turret, by means of a hole reserved for the purpose
in the centre of the dome."</p>

<p class="p1">This little architectural gem with its delicate
exterior carvings has been very carefully preserved.
Up to the eighteenth century it was the
object of a popular and crowded pilgrimage on
May 3rd, but on the destruction of the abbey the
precious indulgences with which it had been dowered
by successive Popes were transferred to the
church of St. Julian at Arles, and it is now nothing
but a "Monument Historique."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>The Last Walk. St. Michel de Frigolet</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">I walked on from Montmajour through the
most delightful country. The road dipped up
and down, crossed thymy, brambly, rocky heaths,
and gave promise of pleasant villages to come.
One begins here to get out of the plain, and
on the low heights the comfortable land, dotted
with nestling farms and towers and steeples, can
be seen stretching away to the white Alpilles,
upon which Les Baux perches and makes its romantic
presence felt, though it cannot be seen.</p>

<p>This little corner is full of curiosities, but I
had a long walk before me and a fair one behind,
and turned aside to see none of them. There are
the remains of the Roman aqueduct, built to carry
the waters of Vaucluse into the Arena at Arles.
It is still called Ouide de Sarrasin (stonework of
the Saracens) by the country people, because the
Spanish Moors marched along it to attack Arles.
At the foot of the Montagne de Cordes are the
remains of fortifications, contemporary and perhaps
built by the invading Saracens. On the top
of the same hill is the Grotto of the Fairies, with
its curious pavement and stones which were cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
in prehistoric times. And there are other megalithic
remains in the little hill of Castellet, and
a cavern in which were found a hundred skeletons,
and among other objects ornaments of a stone
only to be found in the Indies and the Caucasus.
The French call it <i>calaïs</i>; I do not know its English
name. All these things are to be seen within
a mile or two of Montmajour.</p>

<p>But two of the sights I did see, because they
lay right on my road, and the second of them
I would have gone out of it a reasonable distance
to see in any case.</p>

<p>The first was the "<i>allées couvertes</i>," of which
signposts obligingly give notice, at so many
metres from the road. They are subterranean
passages, running at a short distance beneath
the surface, on either side of the road and parallel
to it, broken into here and there, and their entrances
covered with brambles. When they were
constructed, or what for, I have not the slightest
idea, and no book that I have been able to get
hold of tells me. My impression is that they extend
for some miles, but I don't know where I
got it from, and perhaps I am wrong. The
"<i>allées couvertes</i>" are a mystery of which I am
content to be without the key.</p>

<p>But nearly halfway between Arles and Tarascon
is the charming little village of Fontvieille,
and there is something to see there that I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
not willingly have missed. It is the disused mill
which Alphonse Daudet bought to retire to as
a young man, and from which he wrote that delightful
collection of tales and essays about his
beloved native country to which he gave the title
"Lettres de Mon Moulin." They breathe Provence,
as nothing modern does, except the works
of Mistral and his brother Félibres, and some of
the tales of Jean Aicard, and if one wanted to
make a pilgrimage to the heart of it, one would
come either to the "Mas" at Maillane in which
Mistral was born, or to Daudet's mill at Fontvieille.</p>

<p>Nevertheless when I came within sight of it I
was a trifle disappointed. There it stood on its
thymy hill overlooking the village, familiar enough
in its aspect from the photograph in my edition
of this book. But there were two other mills exactly
like it on the little hill, and all three quite
close together; and it was in full view of the
village, and not very far from it. I had imagined
a place of more reflective solitude. I was glad
to have seen it, but did not trouble to go up and
examine it more closely.</p>

<p class="p1">In the evening I came to the roadside chapel
of St. Gabriel, which was marked on my map
with a cross, showing it to be something worth
looking at, but was left without mention alike
by the German Baedeker and the French Joanne.
It is just a single, heavily buttressed nave with a
richly carved porch, within the arch of which is
a curious relief representing Adam and Eve in
the Garden of Eden. It stands in an olive garden
by the side of the road and there are no other
buildings quite near to it, so that it comes as
something of a surprise. It is important, as I
have learnt since from Mr. T. A. Cook, as a link
in the progression of early Provençal architecture,
and is certainly worth seeing on its own
account.</p>

<p>A little farther on was an <i>auberge</i>, before
which some great wagons were standing while
their drivers refreshed themselves within. It was
in a quiet and pleasant corner, where four roads
met, all overshadowed by trees now in their full
leafage. I should have liked to get a bed and
a dinner there, as by this time I had walked quite
far enough, and it was the sort of peaceful countrified
place that it is pleasant to wake up in.
But they did not want me, and after sitting there
for a time I tramped the three or four miles into
Tarascon.</p>

<p>It was dark by the time I got there, and I saw
very little of the immortal Tartarin's town. I
went up under an old gateway, and wandered
about the streets on the lookout for an inn. I
would have taken the first that came, for I was
very tired by this time. But I could not find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
one at all. At last I was directed to a large
hotel, where they gave me a bad dinner and
charged me preposterously.</p>

<p>But I got a good deal of fun out of it. Tarascon
is a military town, and the big dining-room
in a corner of which I sat was providing entertainment
for many of the soldiers of the regiments
quartered there, and their friends among
the townspeople. There were cavalry officers in
natty little Cambridge-blue tunics, and troopers
with tunics of a deeper shade of blue. They did
not mix, but their friends were all of the same
class, and of course a trooper of a French cavalry
regiment may be just as well bred as his
officers. It seemed to me, remembering the character
that Daudet fixed upon the Tarasconnais,
that he had done them no injustice. There was
a sort of theatrical swagger about those that
came within my view that marked them off from
their companions of the military even more than
their civilian garb. I remember Sir Henry Irving
in "The Lyons Mail" taking a meal with
his back to the audience. He seemed to be eating
chiefly with his shoulders, and that was exactly
the way in which these gentlemen of Tarascon
ate, as if they were in the limelight, and everything
must be done for effect. When they talked,
they did so with terrific emphasis and gesticulation,
and when somebody else was talking they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
would suddenly withdraw themselves from the
conversation and reflectively twirl their moustaches.
And when my waiter, who was tremendously
overworked, did bring my long pauses of
reflection to an end, he served me with a flourishing
air that would have made it almost indecent
to complain of being kept waiting, since my
reward was to be attended to with an amount of
pomp and circumstance that must warm the coldest
of victuals.</p>

<p>I was up early next morning and walked out
of the town by a roundabout way, which gave me
a sight of its quaint arcaded streets, King René's
castle, which would have been worth a visit if I had
had time for it, and the suspension bridge across
the river to Beaucaire. I passed along a plane-shaded
boulevard on the outskirts of the town,
always on the lookout for Tartarin's villa, which
I think I saw, though there were no signs of the
india-rubber tree in its elegant little garden.</p>

<p>I was on a literary pilgrimage. You remember
Daudet's story "L'Elixir du Révérend Père
Gaucher"&mdash;how the monastery of the White
Canons had fallen upon such evil times that even
the belfry was as silent as a deserted dovecot, and
the monks, for lack of money, were obliged to
sound to matins with rattles of almond-wood;
how the humble cowherd restored them to affluence
by the cordial cunningly distilled from Provençal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
herbs, of which he had learnt the secret
from the naughty old woman who had brought
him up; and the dreadful things that followed
when the wonderful elixir proved too seductive
for his soul's health. Now this monastery was
St. Michel de Frigolet, up in the hills a mile
or two off the road from Tarascon to Avignon,
and there is a good deal more attached to it than
Daudet's story.</p>

<p>To begin with, Mistral went to school there,
and I will make use of another chapter of his
Memoirs to describe its situation and tell its
story.</p>

<p class="b1">It was nearly eighty years ago that he was
taken there from Maillane in the farm cart, together
with a small folding bed, a deal box to hold
his papers and a bristly pigskin trunk containing
his books and belongings.</p>

<p class="pbq">"At the Revolution, the lands of Saint-Michel
had been sold piece by piece for paper money,
and the despoiled abbey, deserted and solitary, remained
up there, bereft in the wilds, open to the
four winds and the wild animals. Sometimes
smugglers would use it to make their powder in.
When it rained the shepherds would shelter their
sheep in the church. The gamblers of the neighbourhood
would hide there in winter at midnight
to avoid the police, and there by the pale light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of a few candles, as the gold followed the movement
of the cards, the vaulted roof echoed
with oaths and blasphemies instead of psalms.
Then when their game was finished these rakes
ate and drank and revelled and rioted until
dawn.</p>

<p class="pbq">"About 1832 some mendicant friars established
themselves there. They had put a bell in the old
Roman belfry, and rang it on Sundays. But
they rang in vain; nobody came up the hill to
their offices, for they had no faith in them. The
Duchess de Berry about this time had come to
Provence to raise the Carlists against Louis
Philippe, and I remember it being whispered
that these runaway friars were nothing but Spanish
bandits under their black robes plotting some
dubious intrigue.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Following these friars a worthy native of
Cavaillon, M. Donnat, came and started a boarding-school
for boys at the Convent of Saint-Michel,
which he had bought on credit.</p>

<p class="pbq">"He was an old bachelor, yellow and swarthy
in complexion, with lank hair, flat nose, large
mouth with prominent teeth, in a long black
frock-coat and tanned shoes. Very devout, and
as poor as a church mouse, he had made shift to
start his school and to find pupils without a penny
to bless himself with.</p>

<p class="pbq">"For instance, he would go to Graveson, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Tarascon, or Barbentane or Saint-Pierre to a
farmer who had boys.</p>

<p class="pbq">"'I have come to tell you,' he would say, 'that
I have opened a school at Saint-Michel de Frigolet.
You have thus at your very door an excellent
institution to which you can send your sons
and have them prepared for their examinations.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'My dear sir,' the father of the family would
reply, 'that may be all very well for rich
people, but we are not the sort of folk to give
our boys so much learning. They will have quite
enough for working on the land.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Look here,' M. Donnat would say, 'there
is nothing better than a good education. Don't
worry about payment. Give me every year so
many measures of corn, so many casks of wine,
so many drums of oil, and arrange matters in
that way.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"So the worthy farmer would send his children
to Saint-Michel de Frigolet.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Then I suppose M. Donnat would go to a
tradesman and begin thus:</p>

<p class="pbq">"'What a fine boy you have there! He looks
sharp enough, too. I suppose you are not going
to turn him into a counter-jumper.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Oh, sir, if we only could, we should be glad
to give him a little education, but schools are dear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>and when there isn't much money&mdash;&mdash;!'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'If it's a question of a school,' M. Donnat
would reply, 'send him to mine at Saint-Michel
de Frigolet. We will teach him Latin and make
a man of him. As for payment, let it come out
of the shop. You will have an extra customer in
me, and a very good customer too.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"And then and there the shopkeeper would
promise him his son.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Another time he would pass a carpenter's
house, and supposing he saw a child playing in
the gutter who looked pale, he would say to his
mother: 'What's the matter with this pretty little
fellow? He looks very white. Is he ill, or has
he been eating cinders?'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Oh, no,' she would reply, 'it is always playing
about that makes him look like that. Play
is meat and drink to him, sir.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Well, then, why not send him to my school
at Saint-Michel de Frigolet?' M. Donnat would
say. 'The good air alone will give him rosy
cheeks in a fortnight. And he will be watched
over and taught his lessons; and when he has been
well educated he will find an easier occupation
than a carpenter's.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Ah, sir! But when one is poor!'</p>

<p class="pbq">"'Don't trouble about that. We have up
there I don't know how many doors and windows
to mend. I can promise your husband more work
as a carpenter than he will know how to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
through; and so, my good woman, we shall settle
the matter of fees.'</p>

<p class="pbq">"So this child would also find himself at
Saint-Michel, with those of the butcher, the
baker and the candlestick-maker, and by these
means M. Donnat collected into his school about
forty boys, of whom I was one. Out of them
all, I and a few others were there for a money
payment, but three-quarters of them were paid
for in kind, or by the labour of their parents. In
a word, M. Donnat had solved the problem of the
Bank of Exchange, quite simply and without any
fuss, which the celebrated Proudhom tried in vain
to establish in Paris in 1848....</p>

<p class="pbq">"In those days Saint-Michel was of much less
importance than it has since become. There was
left just the cloister of the Augustinian monks,
with its green in the middle of the court; to the
south the refectory and chapter-house; then the
dilapidated church of St. Michael, with its frescoes
of the damned, and of demons armed with
forks, and the battle between the devil and the
great archangel in the middle; and then the
kitchen and stables.</p>

<p class="pbq">"But apart from this little group of buildings
there was a buttressed chapel, dedicated to Our
Lady of Succour, with a porch in front of it.
Masses of ivy covered the walls, and the interior
was lined with gilded carvings which enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
pictures said to be by Mignard representing scenes
in the life of the Virgin. Anne of Austria, mother
of Louis XIV, had given these decorations in accordance
with a vow she had made to the Virgin
if she should bear a son.</p>

<p class="pbq">"This chapel, a real gem, hidden in the mountains,
had been saved during the Revolution by
the good people who piled up fagots under the
porch and hid the entrance. It was there that
every morning in the year, at five o'clock in summer
and six in winter, we were taken to hear
Mass; it was there that I prayed, I remember&mdash;we
all prayed&mdash;with a faith that was really
angelic....</p>

<p class="pbq">"The little hills all around were covered with
thyme, rosemary, asphodel, box and lavender. In
odd corners there were vines, which produced a
wine of some repute-the wine of Frigolet;
patches of olives on the lower slopes; plantations
of almond-trees, twisted, dark and stunted, on
the stony ground; and wild fig-trees in the clefts
of the rocks. This sparse vegetation was all that
these rugged hills could show; the rest was nothing
but waste and scattered rocks. But how delicious
it smelt! The scent of the mountains at
sunrise intoxicated us....</p>

<p class="pbq">"We became as rugged as a troop of gipsies.
But how we revelled in these hills and gorges and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>ravines, with their sonorous Provençal names ...
eternal monuments of the country and its language,
all embalmed in thyme and rosemary and
lavender, all illumined in gold and azure. Oh,
sweet land of scents and colours and delights and
illusions, what happiness, what dreams of paradise
thou didst reveal to my childhood!"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p class="pbq">This idyllic existence came suddenly to an end.
M. Donnat, being frequently away collecting pupils,
neglected to educate them when he had
found them, and being anxious to increase his
numbers took pupils who paid little or nothing,
and they were not those who ate the least. One
morning the cook disappeared.</p>

<p class="p1">"No cook, no broth for us. The masters left
us in the lurch one after the other. M. Donnat
had disappeared. His poor old mother boiled us
some potatoes for a few days, and then his father
said to us one morning, 'Children, there is nothing
more to eat; you had better go home.'"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This was the end of poor M. Donnat's experiment,
and he finally died in an almshouse.</p>

<p class="b1">The old monastery was abandoned for twelve
years, and was then bought by a Premonstrant,
who restored it under the rules of his order, which
had ceased to exist in France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq">"Thanks to the activity and preaching and
begging of this ardent zealot, the little monastery
grew enormously. Numerous crenellated
buildings were added to it, a new, magnificently
decorated church was built, with a nave and two
aisles and two towers. A hundred monks or
novices occupied its cells, and every Sunday the
neighbouring people drove up to admire the
elaborate pomp of their offices. The abbey of
the White Fathers became so popular that when
in 1880 the Republic ordered the convents to be
closed a thousand peasants or inhabitants of the
plains shut themselves up in it to protest against
the execution of the decree. And it was then
that we saw a whole army on the march&mdash;cavalry,
infantry, generals and captains, with their
commissariat and all the apparatus of war&mdash;and
encamping round the Convent of Saint-Michel
de Frigolet, seriously undertaking the siege of
a comic-opera citadel, which would have given in
to four or five gendarmes."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="p1">It may be remembered that the romantic heart
of the immortal Tartarin was stirred within him
to take part in these proceedings. Equipped with
a regular arsenal of weapons, he led his followers
up the hill one dark night and taking immense
pains to circumvent the investing troops crawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
laboriously to the gates of the monastery. As
he was crouching behind a stone, an officer on
guard, who had often met him at his club, called
out affably, "Bon soir, M. Tartarin," and made
no difficulty whatever about his proceeding. The
more people there were inside the monastery to
consume its stock of provisions the quicker the
siege would end. It has been made the basis of
other stories and poems, but Mistral assures us
that none of them are half as comic as were the
facts themselves. I have read elsewhere that two
thousand soldiers, horse and foot, united to expel
twenty recalcitrant but unarmed monks, who were
finally reduced by hunger and led triumphantly
between two files of dragoons to Tarascon.</p>

<p>I do not know when or how the monks came
back to their monastery, but they were finally expelled
with all the rest ten years ago, and settled
themselves somewhere in Belgium.</p>

<p>Well, you will agree that Saint-Michel de
Frigolet was a place to see. I got up to it by
a winding track among the hills. It was a clear,
sunny morning, and the bees were humming
among the scented herbs that give such a character
to these stony hills, just as they did in the
poet's happy childhood. On this side of the hill
were a few olives here and there, but no other
sign of cultivation until I came to the top of
a hill, where there was a patch of dug ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and beyond it a collection of pinnacles and walls
conveying the impression that I had unexpectedly
hit upon a large modern cemetery.</p>

<p>The first building I came to was a tall, jerry-built
structure which seemed to have been used
as a sort of factory. Its doors were open and
its chambers empty and already beginning to fall
to pieces. I walked down the hill between this
and another building of the same sort, modern,
hideous and deserted, and came to a large church,
which looked on the outside much like a pretentious
Nonconformist chapel in a London suburb.
The west doors stood open, and I looked over
an iron railing to find the interior blazing with
gold and bright blues and reds and greens on every
inch of wall and roof, and with coloured windows
to match. At first sight it looked gorgeous, at
second, its gorgeousness was seen to be mere
garish vulgarity. The sacristan was inside, and
I pushed open the iron gate and went in. He
showed me the glories of the church with pride.
He said that the decorations alone had cost one
million six hundred thousand francs, which is
£64,000, and the more I looked the more depressed
I became at the senseless, conscienceless
waste of it all. This was the building that the
Premonstrants had erected in 1854, the "magnificently
decorated church" to which Mistral
describes all the neighbouring countryside flocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to admire the elaborate pomp of its offices.
But all Mistral's artistic genius went into his
poetry. He seems to have been incapable of appreciating
the art that surrounded him so richly.
I was told that the tomb he had erected for himself
in the churchyard at Maillane was a close
copy of the Pavillon de la Reine Jeanne at Les
Baux, but that he had substituted the heads of
favourite dogs for the carvings on the keystones
of the arches; and I came across another instance
of his lack of artistic understanding later on in
his Musée Arlaten.</p>

<p>The Premonstrants have for their object the
celebration of the ceremonies of the Church with
the highest possible degree of elaboration, and I
suppose that when they acquired this monastery
money was lavished upon them for enriching it.
It was the same spirit, one would have said, that
had created the treasures of ecclesiastical art and
architecture of which Provence is so full, but if
so, what had become of its creative force? And
yet the people&mdash;the uncontaminated sons of the
soil, to whom the latest doctrine would have us
look for the truest appreciation of art&mdash;flocked to
this pinchbeck shrine, and took its gaudy ignorance
for a true revival of ancient splendours.</p>

<p>The sacristan took me over the rest of the
buildings. They had all been bought a few years
before by a rich priest who admirably uses them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
for the training of boys whom he sends out to the
colonies. He has bought farms and large tracts
of land all around, and the score or so of youths
that he looks after work on them. I should
have liked a chat with him, but he was away for
the day, and I suppose the boys were all out at
work, for I did not see any of them.</p>

<p>Some of the buildings that were used by the
original monks&mdash;and I suppose also by M. Donnat&mdash;are
used now; others, even of the newer
ones, are empty and some of them dilapidated.
I was shown the library&mdash;two big rooms fitted
up with painted deal shelves from which all the
books had been removed. They looked poor and
desolate, and there was not a trace of architectural
dignity about anything else I saw that had been
built in the last century, though it was all convenient
enough for its purpose.</p>

<p>And yet there was the old church which these
aspiring religionists had left to its quiet decay
while they built their vulgar modern one, the
sweet little peaceful cloister, the chapel of Our
Lady of Succour, which Mistral has described,
with its gilded Louis XIV <i>boiseries</i> round the
altar, from which, however, the pictures had been
removed. They had models around them, if they
had had the wit to use them.</p>

<p>I went down the expensively embanked road
towards Graveson, when I had seen all that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
was to see. It was lined on either side with
heavily built shrines exhibiting the Stations of
the Cross, which looked like the rooks of a set
of clumsy chessmen. And the last thing I saw
of this derelict monument of bad taste, before
the windings of the road hid it, was a large cross
toppling over sideways, as if even that had not
been built to last.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Villeneuve-sur-Avignon</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">My walking was done. I had another day and
a half for Avignon and a day and a half for
Arles, and that was to be the extent of this expedition.
I wish it could have included Carcassonne,
which is not, however, in Provence.
But neither are Nîmes nor Aigues-Mortes, nor
Saintes-Maries nor Saint-Gilles, strictly speaking.
The old province of Provence ended with the
Rhône, and Languedoc began on the other side
of it. I should have liked, too, to renew my
acquaintance with Orange, and visited Montelimar,
if only for the sake of its <i>nougât</i>, and
Martigues, and half a dozen other towns. But
it is not a bad thing to leave out some places in
a country one loves. There is always something
to come back for.</p>

<p>I have said nothing yet about Villeneuve, which,
by the bye, is also in Languedoc; but one can
never forget it in Avignon. The great fort of
St. André frowns across the river on to the papal
city; and the tower of Philip le Bel, at which
the Pont Bénezet used to end, is a conspicuous
object on the lower ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>I suppose the two cities, one very much alive,
the other almost dead, are about a mile apart.
The two branches of the Rhône and the Isle de
Barthelasse are between them. It seems a long
way round by the suspension bridge on a hot day,
but it is worth going there, if only to see Avignon
from the other side. The city stands up magnificently,
its rock crowned by the cathedral and
the palace.</p>

<p>But there is much to see in Villeneuve itself.
There is a fine fourteenth century church, which
contains among other treasures a wonderful ivory
virgin and child, coloured, which was presented
by Cardinal Arnaud de Via, nephew of Pope
John XXII, who founded the church in 1333.
It is kept in an ancient safe in the sacristy, and
there is a tremendous fuss of unlocking by various
keys when it is shown.</p>

<p class="b1">There is also the very fine Gothic tomb of
Pope Innocent VI, which, although much restored,
is still in better preservation than the
not dissimilar one of John XXII in the cathedral
at Avignon.</p>

<p class="pbq">"When seen by Mérrimée in 1834," writes
Mr. Okey, "the monument was in the possession
of a poor vine-grower and used as a cupboard;
casks were piled up against it, and all the beautiful
alabaster statuettes had been destroyed or sold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Another visitor of the period saw the tomb in
use as a rabbit hutch."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p class="p1 b1">The tomb stands in the middle of the little
chapel of the Hôpital, which also contains a small
collection of paintings, one at least of which is
of first-rate importance. It represents the coronation
of the Virgin. It was long attributed to
King René, as were most of the pictures of its
date of which the authorship was doubtful, then
to Jan van Eyck, and then to Van der Meere.
But in 1889 the contract for its painting was
discovered, "drawn up in the spicer's shop of
Jean Brea at Avignon, between a priest, Jean
de Montagnac, and Master Enguerrand Charonton,
of Laon, and dated April 24, 1453." As
this contract shows the sort of terms on which
artists of the middle ages worked, and how little
was left to their own initiative, and is an interesting
document besides, it is worth quoting Mr.
Okey's mention of it.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Every detail is specified, narrowly and precisely,
as in a contract for building a house, and
in order that the artist may have no excuse for
not following the specification, the details are
written in French, whereas the terms of the contract
are in Latin. First, there was to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
representation of a Paradise, and in this Paradise
must be (<i>doit estre</i>) the Holy Trinity. There
is to be no difference between the Father and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost must be in the form
of a dove. Our Lady is to be crowned by the
said Holy Trinity, and the vestments are to be
rich; that of Our Lady is to be cloth of white
damask, figured as may seem best to the said
master. The disposition of the angels and archangels,
the cherubim, seraphim, prophets, patriarchs
and saints is specified in elaborate detail:
moreover, all the estates of the world are to be
represented in the Paradise. Above Paradise
are to be the heavens, with sun and moon, and
the Church of St. Peter, and the walls of Rome
are to be figured over against the setting sun;
and at the issue of the church is to be a pine cone
of bronze; thence spacious steps are to descend
to the great piazza, and a street is to lead to the
bridge of St. Angelo, with houses and shops of
all kinds. The castle of St. Angelo must be also
seen and many churches; the Tiber is to be shown
starting from Rome and entering the sea; and
on the sea are to be a certain number of galleys
and ships. Beyond the sea must be figured part
of Jerusalem: first, the Mount of Olives and the
Crucifixion of my Saviour and a Carthusian in
prayer at the foot of the cross; and a little further
the sepulchre of my Saviour, and an angel saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
<i>Surrexit, non est hic</i>. At the foot of the sepulchre
shall be two (persons) praying; and at the right
side, the Vale of Jehosaphat, between two mountains,
and in the valley a church with the tomb
of Our Lady, and an angel saying: <i>Assumpta est</i>,
etc., and there shall be a figure praying at the foot
of the tomb. On the left is to be a valley, wherein
are three persons of one and the same age, and
from all these three shall shine forth rays of the
sun, and there shall be seen Abraham coming out
of his tent and worshipping the said three persons,
saying, <i>Domini si inveni</i>, etc.; on the second mountain
shall be Moses tending his sheep, and a young
girl playing the pipes, and Our Lord in the burning
bush, and Our Lord shall say: <i>Moyses,
Moyses</i>, and Moses shall answer, <i>Assum</i>. And
on the right shall be Purgatory with angels leading
forth rejoicing those that are going to Paradise,
whereat the devils shall show forth great
grief. On the left side shall be Hell, and an
angel is to be seen comforting the souls in Purgatory.
Then in the part where Hell is shall
be a devil, very hideous, turning his back to the
angel and casting certain souls into Hell which
other devils are handing to him. In Hell and
Purgatory, too, all estates of the world are to
be represented according to the judgment of
the master. The said picture is to be painted
in fine oil colour, and the blue must not be German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
blue but fine blue of Acre; German blue
may, however, be used on the border. The gold
used for the picture and the border must be fine
burnished gold. The said master is to display
all his science in the representation of the Holy
Trinity and the Blessed Virgin, and the rest
may be painted according to his conscience. On
the reverse of the picture is to be painted a fine
cloth of crimson damask figured with fleur-de-lys.
The said master is to have the said picture faithfully
done by St. Michael's Day, and to be paid
120 florins at 24 soldi to the florin, of which sum
the master had received 40 florins on account;
the balance is to be paid&mdash;20 florins when the
picture was half finished; 40, according to the
rate of the progress of the work thereafter; and
the remaining 20 florins when the picture was
completed and delivered at the Carthusian
Church."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="p1">Almost an anecdotal picture! But a very
beautiful one. It was amusing to stand before
it with this description in one's hand and pick
out the various commissions which Master Enguerrand
Charonton so conscientiously fulfilled. They
could do these things, even at that early date,
without sacrificing composition or anything that
is the mark of a great picture in all ages. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
think there are not many artists who could do
it now.</p>

<p>The sleepy high street, or what corresponded
to such, of the once famous city is full of
memorials of its past grandeur, although they are
for the most part hidden behind the rows of
ordinary looking house-fronts. There are courtyards
surrounded by stately buildings, deposed
from their once high estate, when the princes of
the Church and the great nobles of Provence had
their summer palaces here; but the main surprise
that Villeneuve holds out to the visitor is
the ruins of the great charter house of the Val
de Benediction, which was founded by Innocent
III, and so grew in importance that it became
the second of the Order.</p>

<p>It is a surprising place to visit. The circuit
of the walls was a full mile round, and they
are mostly standing on the two sides towards the
open country. On the other two sides there are
streets, and the main entrance is in the Grande
Rue&mdash;a fine gateway standing between the house-fronts
and leading by a vaulted passage to what
is left of the monastic buildings. These are all
mixed up with houses and cottages, some rebuilt
from the old materials, others adapted for modern
dwellings out of the walls as they stood.
At the Revolution the monastery was sacked, and
its buildings sold in small lots. There are said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to have been two hundred families of the poorer
sort living within the walls, and there are still
a very large number, although the whole is
being very gradually bought up, and as much as
possible of it restored as an historical monument.</p>

<p>The church still stands, though in advanced
ruin, and the chapel of the Holy Trinity, built
by Innocent VI retains some of its frescoes.
There are also the remains of a fine cloister, and
in the cloister garth is the eighteenth century
rotunda, built over the old well of St. Jean.
To my mind, however, the interesting thing about
these ruins are not the important remains, but
the endless little ones that one comes across as
one wanders about the narrow alleys and yards.
There is probably not a hovel that has not got
something about it that tells of the past. As I
was poking about, two urchins accosted me and
asked if I would like to see the <i>plafond</i>. They
took me to a house standing in a row of others
like it&mdash;a house of perhaps half a dozen rooms&mdash;and
up a stone stair into a bedroom of which
the ceiling was painted, not in the least ecclesiastically,
but in a good eighteenth century style.
It was in excellent preservation, and indeed the
whole house, into some of the other rooms of
which I peeped, was no more dilapidated than any
house might be that had come down in the world,
but not so very far. I do not know what purpose
it may have served in the monastic days.
I suppose there were those in this great monastery
who lived much in the style of people outside,
and this was the dwelling of one of them. The
place was a town in itself, and not a very small
one.</p>

<p class="p1">The photograph of the Rotunda will give some
idea of the sort of buildings that now surround
this and other remains of the past. A lane runs
round the two sides of the old walls that do not
face the town, and doors are cut into them leading
to the houses inside, or into their yards. The
clearing out must be a very slow process, if all
the descendants of those who acquired the many
"lots" at the Revolution are to be removed. I
doubt if the result will be worth while, except
here and there. The whole has been destroyed
and altered past repair, and it is interesting
enough in its present state.</p>

<p>The mighty fort of St. André stands on the
hill above the monastery. With its double fortress
towers and frowning battlements, it is the most
conspicuous object in Villeneuve as seen from
Avignon, and Avignon is seen from its heights,
as well as the wonderful stretch of country around,
perhaps to greater advantage than from any other
point.</p>

<p class="b1">Its long history was closed, except for later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
restorations, by an occupation which Mr. Okey
describes as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq">"In the later years of the monarchy a post of
artillery was stationed in the fort, and it was from
the fire of a battery planted there that a young
captain of artillery, one Napoleon Bonaparte, in
1793, overawed the city of Avignon, which was
occupied by the Marseillais federalists who had
declared against the Convention; and it was with
the cannon seized at St. André that Bonaparte
marched to Toulon and expelled the English from
its harbour. The papal soldiery were ever objects
of scorn to the royalists of Villeneuve, who
dubbed them <i>patachines</i> (<i>petachina</i>, Italian for
slipper), and taunted them with drilling under
parasols&mdash;a pleasantry repaid by the Italians who
hurled the epithet <i>luzers</i> (lizards) against the
royalists, who were said to pass their time sunning
themselves against the hot rocks of Villeneuve."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>Arles</i></p>


<p>Of all the larger towns in Provence, Arles is
perhaps the one that creates the deepest impression
upon the visitor. Avignon is much finer,
and its interest is at least as great as that of
Arles, although it lacks that of Roman remains.
And the Roman remains of Nîmes are finer than
those of Arles, although Nîmes has very little
mediæval interest. But both Avignon and Nîmes
are thriving modern cities, while Arles is a comparatively
small provincial town. Its ancient
remains are everything, and you can never forget
them in connection with it.</p>

<p>I do not remember any feeling of modernity
at all about Arles. The streets are cobbled, narrow
and puzzling. If you once get away from
any central point you must use a map to get
back again. I do not remember any modern
houses or any large shops. It is a sleepy old
town, and a pleasant one to wander about in,
even when one has no immediate object in the
direction of its outstanding antiquities.</p>

<p>Of the Arena I need say little. The exterior
is less striking than that of Nîmes, because it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
not nearly so well preserved. The arches of the
upper tier stand naked all the way round, and
it is not possible anywhere to get an idea of what
the exterior looked like without more knowledge
and imagination than most visitors are likely to
possess. The interior, as will be seen by the
photograph, has been to some extent restored
for spectacular purposes. As it was built to
hold thirty thousand spectators, and the whole
population of Arles is now about half that number,
the ancient seats of honour afford ample accommodation,
and the rest has been left to its
ruin.</p>

<p>But this ruin is really a considerable restoration
in itself. The arenas, both at Arles and
Nîmes, suffered many vicissitudes after the Roman
occupation. The square tower above the entrance
was a fortification of the Saracens, and
there is another still standing which is not shown
in the photograph. In the seventeenth century
the whole area was crowded with houses. According
to contemporary prints, the round tops
of the arches, with the coping above them removed,
formed the roofs of separate narrow dwellings;
here and there extensions clung to the outside
walls; the interior was a mass of buildings
and alleys, and there was even a church. It was
a little town within a town, and a very horrible
one at certain times of its history, for it was the
resort of criminals of the basest type, who made
a sort of fortress of it. In 1640 the plague that
ravaged Arles broke out first in this crowded den,
and its inhabitants were shot down if they came
out of it. It was not until 1825 that it began
to be cleared of buildings, and a careful restoration
was set in hand twenty years later and carried
on slowly until the present considerable result
was attained.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The remains of the Greek theatre are unfortunately
even less complete, but they are enough to
cause one to linger over this unique survival of
ancient days. The two beautiful marble columns
which remain give one an idea of what the proscenium
must have been like. One is of white
marble from Carrara, the other of African marble.
Charles IX took eight columns of porphyry and
one of verd-antique for shipment to Paris, and
they were lost in the Rhône. One would willingly
exchange the whole of the Arena&mdash;contenting
oneself with that of Nîmes&mdash;for an equal preservation
of the theatre. But its destruction dates
very far back. It was in 441 that the Deacon
Cyril aroused a fanaticism that led a Christian
mob to attack and wreck it, and they left it in
little better state than it is now. In 1664 a
monastery was built with the materials, actually
on the stage of the theatre itself.</p>

<p>This complete and sudden demolition, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
had the effect of preserving some precious objects
which would otherwise have disappeared entirely.
When excavations were made, possibly in preparation
for the building of the monastery, there
was brought to light the beautiful Vénus d'Arles,
now in the Louvre, and there are other priceless
remains of statuary and architecture in the Musée
Lapidaire of Arles itself, which go to show what
a treasure-house this theatre was; for the early
iconoclasts paid special attention to the destruction
of the statuary.</p>

<p>Behind the stage of the theatre rises the Romanesque
tower of the cathedral of St. Trophime.
This wonderful church has suffered as little as
anything of its date in Provence. Its carved
façade is not so fine as that of St. Gilles, but it
has been better preserved, and while St. Gilles
has lost nearly everything that was behind its
façade, St. Trophime has kept nearly everything.</p>

<p>The interior of the church is very solid and
very dignified. It has little decoration, but the
light that is let in on it is just enough to give
it mystery and solemnity. The aisles are so narrow
that looking up to the vaulting one has the
impression of mere passages, but their narrowness
is effective, and the whole structure conveys an
uplifting sense of austerity.</p>

<p>The richness of the famous cloister, happily in
good preservation, comes as something of a surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
when one steps into it from the dark church,
though its earliest "walk" is of the same date
as the portal and not less luxuriant in decoration.
This beautiful cloister is one of the most satisfying
things in all ecclesiastical Provence, and would
make a visit to Arles memorable if there were
nothing else there to see. A chapter might be
written on its carvings alone, and its irregularities
of date and of construction provide constant fresh
interest. The photographs of the north and south
walks will show the great variety that exists. The
north is of the twelfth century, the south as it
was altered at the end of the fourteenth, and
the west is later still. At the south-east corner
is a well, said to have been originally fed by a
Roman aqueduct which was older than the amphitheatre,
for the water rose in a channel cut
through the rock beneath it.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry James speaks of the Musée Lapidaire
as the most Roman thing he knows of outside
Rome, and, indeed, its contents, which are not
so numerous as to confuse the mind, show what
Arles had lost in the way of beauty centuries
before St. Trophimus and other mediæval glories
were bestowed upon it. I was pleased to come
across, in Mr. James's pages, mention of the delightful
little boy's head in marble, of the second
century, which had particularly struck me. There
is another similar one, not quite in such perfection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
but even more tender and "naturalistique".
One seems to know these little children, who died
close upon two thousand years ago, and almost
to love them.</p>

<p class="b1">In the Musée are some of the finest of the
early Christian tombs from the Alyscamps, which
has enriched half the museums in Europe with
its treasures. This ancient burying-place lies a
little outside the town. It is a rather mournful
avenue of poplars underneath which are the rows
of stone coffers, all empty now, which remain of
the many that once stood there, and an ancient
ruined church at the end of it.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Here," writes Mr. T. A. Cook, "was the
true necropolis of Gaul, consecrated, as the legend
runs, by the blessing of the Christ Himself, who
appeared to St. Trophime upon this sacred spot....
At first a Roman burial-place, this cemetery
gradually became the chosen bourne of every
man who wished his body to await in peace the
coming of the resurrection. By the twelfth century
it was sufficient to place the corpse of some
beloved dead, from Avignon or further, into a
rude coffin, fashioned like a barrel, and to commit
it to the Rhône, which brought its quiet
charge in safety to the beach of La Roquette.
No sacrilegious hands were ever laid upon that
travelling bier; for once a man of Beaucaire had
robbed the coffin that was floating past his bridge,
and straightway the corpse remained immovable
in the current of the river, and stayed there until
the thief confessed his crime and put the jewels
back."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The ancient church of St. Honorat, at the
end of the avenue, is in a sad state of desolation,
for its ruin went very far before what was left
of it began to be cared for. I remember little
of it but the octagonal domed belfry which gives
it its character in the scene, the enormous round
pillars of the interior, and a side chapel which
interested me because it belonged to the Porcelets
of Les Baux. St. Honorat was only one of nineteen
churches and chapels within the Alyscamps
when it was most famous. The translation of
the body of St. Trophimus to the cathedral in
1152 took away something of its prestige. It
was served by the monks of St. Victor of Marseilles
until the middle of the fifteenth century,
by which time the people of Arles seem to have
realized that they had an almost inexhaustible
supply of coveted Christian antiquities to dispose
of, and ever since the sixteenth century the spoliation
has been going on. There is nothing of much
value left compared with what can be seen of the
treasures of the Alyscamps elsewhere, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the sacred ground has been whittled away by degrees,
and the railway has set up workshops on
the very spot where so many Christians of the
first centuries were buried. One hears the clang
of metal as one walks along the melancholy
avenue, or stands in the empty ruined church.
The glory has all departed, and most of the
romance.</p>

<p>There are many other memories of the past in
Arles, but they need not detain us. The ancient
city has of late years been the centre of the
Provençal revival of the Félibres, and we may
take leave of it as well as of the charming land
of Provence, with a glance at the Musée Arlaten,
which owes its foundation to the patriotism and
largely to the generosity of Mistral.</p>

<p>It is housed in a fine old mansion built round
a courtyard in which have lately been discovered
some valuable Roman remains. It fills all the
rooms and passages of the first floor and is
already an ethnological and local museum of great
value. They call it the Palace of the Félibrige,
and it aims to sum up all the life and traditions
of Provence. "Art, letters, customs, manners,
pottery, costumes, furniture," announces the catalogue,
"all are there. The whole of Provence
unfolds itself and lives again in all its aspects
in these admirable galleries, masterpieces of patience
as well as genius."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>The patience as well as the genius have been
mostly Mistral's. His neat, angular writing is
to be seen on nearly all the labels, and up to
the very week before his death he came regularly
to the museum one day every week and worked
there cataloguing and arranging. As I was waiting
at Graveson station after visiting Saint-Michel
de Frigolet, the station-master told me how much
they should miss him. Every Thursday he would
come over from Maillane, in the old diligence,
and take the train to Arles. He talked a great
deal about his museum. It was his pride and
his chief interest of latter years.</p>

<p>One of the smaller rooms is called the Salo
Mistralenco, or the Cabinet de Mistral. "The
walls of this <i>salle d'honneur</i> are decorated with
illustrations of <i>Mireille</i>, <i>Nerte</i>, <i>Calendal</i>, &amp;c. On
the chimneypiece a superb bust of the Master.
In glass cases: the works of Mistral, things that
have belonged to him, the 'original' of the great
Nobel Prize adjudged to the poet, and a letter
to the same from Roosevelt, President of the
United States, etc. In the middle of the <i>salle</i>,
a wonderful reliquary estimated at over 10,000
francs, the gift of M. Mistral-Bernard of Saint-Remy:
it contains the hair, the christening robe
and the cradle of the infant Mistral; in the cradle
the manuscript of 'Mireille.'"</p>

<p>There may seem something a little odd to English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
ideas in this naïve acceptance of immortality,
and preparation for the veneration of posterity,
in a man's own lifetime. But Mistral's advanced
years may excuse it, if excuse is needed. Long
ago he saw his cause triumph, and it is a cause
that looms big in Provence. He could hardly help
knowing that he was its central figure, and from
the very first he has laid all the fame that it
brought him at the feet of his beloved country.
In any case the slight anachronism will soon disappear.
It was already beginning to fade away
when I was there in the week after his death, and
saw the chamber darkened and the pathetic reminders
of his infancy all swathed and wreathed
in black.</p>

<p class="b1">Two of the larger rooms have been given up
to a kind of wax-work show, the one of a Christmas
Eve feast in the kitchen of a Provençal farm,
the other of the ceremonies surrounding the birth
of a child. The descriptions in the catalogue,
probably written by Mistral himself, may be
quoted.</p>

<p class="pbq">"Salle de Noël.&mdash;Here is Christmas Eve represented
in all the truth of its poetry, very spaciously
and completely, in the kitchen of a Provençal
'mas.' A dozen very expressive <i>mannequins</i>
in coloured stucco by M. Férigoule represent
the inhabitants of the farm.... On the
table; three cloths and three candles; the <i>pain
calendal</i> is served with the great pike cooked with
black olives, and with snails, celery, artichokes,
brandied raisins, and the little cask of mulled
wine. By the hearth, facing the grandmother,
the head of the house sprinkles with wine and
blesses the Yule log. Round the table the servants
mix with the masters: here family simplicity
equalizes all ranks.</p>

<p class="p1">"Chambre Conjugale.&mdash;Another group, superb
in arrangement, expression and poetry. In the
room, discreetly lighted, there arrive, wonderfully
dressed in Arlésian costume, the relations and
friends of the young mother, lying with her new-born
child in a bed of the fifteenth century. The
visitors are bringing the symbolical and traditional
gifts, of bread, salt, a match and an egg. They
are expressing the customary wishes: <i>Sage coume
la sau;&mdash;bon coume lou pan;&mdash;plen coume un
ion;&mdash;dre coume uno brouqueto</i>; which means,
May your child be as wholesome as salt, as good
as bread, as full as an egg, and as straight as a
match. With what jealous care does the grandmother,
seated apart, seem to watch that those
coming and going shall behave quietly! Bravo,
M. Férigoule, for your composition; you have
done the work of an artist. The scene, indeed,
is religious in its impression."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I suppose M. Férigoule has done his
work as well as such work can be done; but as for
art!&mdash;it is the negation of all art, this imitation of
life, which is as dead as the stuff of which it is
made. The more realistic such figures are the
more dreadful they are. For my part I can
never look at them without a shudder, and those
in the Musée Arlaten took away all my pleasure
in the careful and interesting furnishing of the
rooms, in which they stand and sit and lie in
their horrible immobility. If only they were
taken out, how imagination might play about the
rooms themselves, which contain every detail of
the warm picturesque home-life of the past, now
fading away. With them, imagination is killed.
It is as if the rooms had been prepared for corpses.</p>

<p>But one must not let one's disgust for these
<i>mannequins</i>, which cannot be felt by everybody,
or so great a man as Mistral would not have been
so pleased with them, stand for one's whole impression
of this interesting museum. I spent a
couple of hours in it very happily employed in
gathering up the pleasure that this spring expedition
in Provence had brought me. It touches on
all the life and all the memories of that fascinating
country, and it is especially rich in the accessories
of the ancient and picturesque work of the
soil, perhaps more ancient and more picturesque
in Provence than in most countries. In Mistral's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
youth there can have been little change from the
ways of centuries past. He lived to see much that
made his country unlike others disappear, and
gathered what he could in his museum so that it
should not be forgotten. But it has not all disappeared.
Except here and there, men and
women have given up their old distinctive costumes,
harvests are reaped by machinery, the
Rhône no longer bears its freights drawn by the
huge teams of horses or oxen, the festivals of the
church do not see every house decked and every
street strewn with green. But the queenly Arlésian
women still wear their becoming coifs; and
on high days and holidays some of the rich
dresses, of which there is such a variety in this
museum, are taken out of old coffers and presses,
in the great country farmhouses the old furniture
that has descended from father to son is polished
and cherished, and many of the old customs are
kept up. The harvest of the olives sees the girls
of Provence filling their baskets as they did in
the days of Mireille, and the old-fashioned mills
grind out their tons of rich oil. The shepherds
lead their flocks over the stony, herb-scented hills
as they led them when Marius drove out the barbarians.
The wild bulls and horses roam the
plains of the Camargue, and the life of the men
who have to do with them is not changed.</p>

<p>Of all these things, and many others, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
evidence in the Musée Arlaten, and walking
through the country one sees it for one's self,
enough at least to make one love the fair sunburnt
land that holds so many memories, and to
love its roads and fields and hills no less than the
treasures it hoards in its ancient cities.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="pn center mid"><i>The Provençal Legend</i></p>

<p class="pn p2">Dr. M. R. James has sent me a pamphlet, "Saint Lazare et
Saint Maximin," by Dom G. Morin, which, although published
in Paris in 1897, he considers to be the last word on the
Provençe legends of St. Lazarus, etc. I summarize its conclusions
shortly.</p>

<p>1. Dom Morin produces evidence that the cult of St.
Lazarus by the Church of Marseilles, which dates at least
from the eleventh century, has, for historic foundation, the
burial of a bishop of that name in the crypt of the Abbey of
Saint-Victor. This was not the Lazarus of the New Testament,
but most probably a Bishop of Aix in the first half of
the fifth century, who was dispossessed of his See for the
part that he had taken in the Pelagian controversy, and came
to end his days with the Bishop of Marseilles, who had
ordained him.</p>

<p>2. For the cult of the saints of Saint-Maximin there is an
ingenious and probable explanation. In the ancient town of
Billom, in the Auvergne, and in the adjacent villages, the
relics of several saints were venerated from a very early date.
Among them were St. Maximin, a Confessor, perhaps a
Bishop; St. Sidonius, who was none other than Sidonius
Apollinaris, the fifth century poet and orator; St. Marcelle,
a shepherdess for whom the villagers of Chauriat have had
from time immemorial a deep veneration.</p>

<p>Now these are not names that are to be found scattered all
over the martyrologies. Besides those of Billom and Saint-Maximin,
there are only three or four other St. Maximins,
one St. Sidonius, and two St. Marcelles; and there are not
two of any of them, otherwise, who can be referred to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
same locality or between whom there exists any connection
whatever. Dom Morin can find no other explanation of this
curious 'bilocation' than by supposing a translation of relics
either from Auvergne to Provence or from Provence to
Auvergne; and he gives good reasons for preferring the first
supposition.</p>
